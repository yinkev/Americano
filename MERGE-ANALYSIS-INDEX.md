## Key Findings Summary

### Critical Issues Discovered

1. **Epic 4 Deleted Epic 3's 21 Models**
   - Severity: HIGH - Data Loss Risk
   - Impact: Requires investigation of production database
   - Decision Required: Restore Epic 3 models or skip?

   - Epic 5: 33 models (to merge)
   - Total: 48-55 models depending on Epic 3 decision

### File Conflicts

**Total:** 10 files (manageable)

**Critical:**

## Merge Complexity Assessment

| Factor | Rating | Notes |
|--------|--------|-------|
| **File Conflicts** | Low | Only 10 files |
| **Schema Conflicts** | Critical | 3-way merge, 2,642 lines diff |
| **Dependency Conflicts** | Medium | Both epics added packages |
| **Model Name Conflicts** | High | 2 models need renaming |
| **Epic 3 Data Loss Risk** | Critical | Depends on production status |
| **Overall Complexity** | HIGH | Due to schema reconciliation |

## Recommended Action Plan

### Phase 1: Investigation (1 hour)
**Owner:** DevOps + Product
**Objective:** Determine Epic 3 production status

Tasks:
- [ ] Query production DB for Epic 3 table data
- [ ] Check if FirstAid/semantic search features are live
- [ ] Review Epic 3 API route usage logs
- [ ] Make decision: Restore Epic 3 models or skip?

**Output:** Go/No-Go decision on Epic 3 restoration

---

### Phase 2: Preparation (30 min)
**Owner:** Engineering
**Objective:** Set up merge environment

Tasks:
- [ ] Create reconciliation branch
- [ ] Backup Epic 5 schema
- [ ] Document current state
- [ ] Notify team of merge in progress

---

### Phase 3: Merge Execution (4-6 hours)
**Owner:** Engineering Lead
**Objective:** Complete three-way merge

Tasks:
- [ ] Merge main into Epic 5 branch (conflicts expected)
- [ ] Reconcile schema.prisma manually
  - [ ] Add Epic 3 models (if decided)
  - [ ] Add Epic 4 models with renames
  - [ ] Keep Epic 5 models
- [ ] Resolve package.json dependencies
- [ ] Resolve other file conflicts
- [ ] Generate migration
- [ ] Test migration on clean DB

---

### Phase 4: Validation (2 hours)
**Owner:** Engineering + QA
**Objective:** Verify merge success

Tasks:
- [ ] Run full test suite
- [ ] Verify Epic 4 calibration features
- [ ] Verify Epic 5 behavioral analytics
- [ ] Verify Epic 3 features (if restored)
- [ ] Check TypeScript compilation
- [ ] Test Redis connection
- [ ] Test type generation script

---

### Phase 5: Review & Deploy (1 hour)
**Owner:** Tech Lead + DevOps
**Objective:** Code review and deployment

Tasks:
- [ ] Code review reconciliation
- [ ] Create PR with detailed description
- [ ] Stage deployment
- [ ] Production deployment (if approved)

---

## Risk Mitigation

### High Risks
1. **Data Loss from Epic 3**
   - Mitigation: Production DB investigation before merge
   - Fallback: Restore from backup if needed

2. **Model Name Conflicts**
   - Mitigation: Rename Epic 4 models before merge
   - Fallback: Use fully qualified names if renaming fails

3. **Migration Failure**
   - Mitigation: Test on clean DB first, then staging
   - Fallback: Rollback migration, fix schema, retry

### Medium Risks
1. **Dependency Conflicts**
   - Mitigation: Careful package.json merge
   - Fallback: Remove conflicting packages, test alternatives

2. **Test Failures**
   - Mitigation: Run full test suite multiple times
   - Fallback: Fix failing tests before merge completion

3. **Integration Issues**
   - Mitigation: Integration testing in staging
   - Fallback: Feature flags to disable problematic features

---

## Rollback Plan

If merge fails catastrophically:

```bash
# Abort in-progress merge
git merge --abort

# Return to Epic 5 branch
git checkout feature/epic-5-behavioral-twin

# If already committed and pushed
git reset --hard origin/feature/epic-5-behavioral-twin

# If deployed to staging/production
# Use database backup to restore previous state
# Redeploy previous version from main branch
```

## Questions & Answers

### Q: Why did Epic 4 remove Epic 3 models?
**A:** Epic 4 was likely developed from a branch point BEFORE Epic 3 merged to main, creating a parallel development conflict. When Epic 4 merged, it overwrote main's schema with its own version, removing Epic 3's additions.

### Q: Can we skip Epic 3 restoration entirely?
**A:** Only if:
- Epic 3 features were never deployed to production
- No production database tables have Epic 3 data
- No users are depending on FirstAid/semantic search features

Otherwise, restoration is required to prevent data loss.

### Q: What happens if we don't rename BehavioralPattern/Insight?
**A:** Prisma will throw an error about duplicate model names. The schema won't compile, and migrations will fail. Renaming is mandatory.

### Q: Why not just rebase Epic 5 onto main?
**A:** Rebase would still face the same schema conflicts, and we'd lose the explicit merge commit history. Manual merge is clearer and safer for this complexity level.

### Q: How long will the database migration take?
**A:** Depends on data volume, but likely:
- Clean DB: < 1 minute
- Small dataset: 1-5 minutes
- Production-scale: 10-30 minutes (with downtime)
