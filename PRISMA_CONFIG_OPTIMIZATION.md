# Prisma v6 Configuration Optimization Guide

## Current Status: ✅ BEST PRACTICES IMPLEMENTED

Your project has already implemented the Prisma v6 best practice of using `prisma.config.ts` for centralized configuration. This document explains the deprecation and recommended cleanup.

---

## Background: Prisma v6 Migration

### Legacy Approach (Deprecated)
In Prisma v5 and earlier, configuration lived in `package.json`:
```json
{
  "prisma": {
    "seed": "tsx prisma/seed.ts"
  }
}
```

### Modern Approach (Prisma v6+)
Configuration now lives in `prisma/prisma.config.ts`:
```typescript
export const prismaConfig = {
  log: process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development'
    ? (['query', 'error', 'warn'] as const)
    : (['error'] as const),
  // ... other config
}
```

---

## Your Current Configuration

### ✅ prisma.config.ts (Properly Implemented)
**File:** `/apps/web/prisma/prisma-config.ts`
**Status:** EXCELLENT - Following best practices

Features:
- Environment-aware logging (query logs in dev, errors only in prod)
- Configurable error formatting
- Connection pool management
- Query timeout configuration (30s default, 180s for long-running)
- Batch operation limits (1000 insert, 500 update/delete)

### ⚠️ package.json (Minor Cleanup Needed)
**Current State:**
```json
{
  "devDependencies": {
    "prisma": "^6.17.1",
    "@prisma/client": "^6.17.1"
  }
}
```

**Issue:** The "prisma" entry is now considered a devDependency used during development only. With prisma.config.ts in place, it's not necessary to list it in package.json.

---

## Recommended Fix

### Safe to Remove? ✅ YES

**Why it's safe:**
1. `prisma.config.ts` is automatically loaded by Prisma CLI
2. `@prisma/client` is sufficient for runtime
3. Prisma CLI is still available via `npx prisma` (globally cached)
4. No application code depends on "prisma" being in package.json

### Implementation

**Step 1: Update package.json**
```diff
{
  "devDependencies": {
-   "prisma": "^6.17.1",
    "@prisma/client": "^6.17.1"
  }
}
```

**Step 2: Verify Prisma CLI Still Works**
```bash
npx prisma validate          # Should work
npx prisma generate          # Should work
npx prisma db push           # Should work
```

**Step 3: No Other Changes Needed**
- `prisma.config.ts` continues to work (no changes required)
- All development scripts continue to work
- CI/CD pipelines continue to work

---

## Impact Analysis

### What Changes
- One fewer dependency in package.json
- Slightly smaller node_modules directory
- Cleaner package.json following Prisma v6 conventions

### What Stays the Same
- All development workflows
- All production deployments
- All scripts and configurations
- All Prisma client functionality
- All database operations

### Risk Level: **MINIMAL**
This is a straightforward cleanup with no behavioral changes.

---

## Implementation Steps

### Option A: Manual Edit
1. Open `/apps/web/package.json`
2. Remove the `"prisma": "^6.17.1",` line
3. Save file
4. Run `npm install` or `pnpm install`

### Option B: CLI Command
```bash
npm remove --save-dev prisma
# or
pnpm remove --save-dev prisma
```

### Option C: Keep As-Is
If you prefer to keep it for explicit clarity, there's no functional downside. This is just a cleanup recommendation.

---

## Validation After Fix

Run these commands to verify everything still works:

```bash
# Validate schema
npx prisma validate
# Expected output: The schema at prisma/schema.prisma is valid 🚀

# Generate Prisma Client
npx prisma generate
# Expected output: ✔ Generated Prisma Client

# List database changes (without applying)
npx prisma db pull --dry-run
# Expected output: (shows current state without changes)
```

---

## Why This Matters

### Code Quality
- Removes deprecated patterns
- Follows Prisma v6+ conventions
- Reduces confusion for new team members
- Cleaner git diffs

### Team Standards
From AGENTS.MD:
> "Every agent that is called reads AGENTS.MD, CLAUDE.md and uses context7 for updated documentation."

This cleanup aligns with modern development standards for Prisma v6.

### Future-Proofing
- Prisma v7 will further discourage package.json config
- Explicit configuration in prisma.config.ts is the future
- Easier migration path when/if Prisma v7 is released

---

## Rollback Plan

If anything goes wrong, simply restore the line:
```bash
npm install --save-dev prisma@^6.17.1
# or
pnpm add --save-dev prisma@^6.17.1
```

## Recommendation Summary

| Aspect | Recommendation | Priority | Effort |
|--------|---|----------|--------|
| Remove "prisma" from package.json | YES | Medium | 1 minute |
| Keep "@prisma/client" | YES | Critical | - |
| Keep prisma.config.ts | YES | Critical | - |
| Validate after cleanup | YES | High | 2 minutes |
