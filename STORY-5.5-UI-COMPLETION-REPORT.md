4. **Experiment Creation:** "Create Experiment" button is placeholder (UI only)

### Recommended Future Enhancements
1. **Real-Time Dashboard:** WebSocket integration for live updates
2. **Export Functionality:** Download effectiveness data as CSV
3. **Experiment Templates:** Pre-configured experiment variants for common scenarios
4. **Mobile App:** Native iOS/Android apps for dashboard access
5. **Email Notifications:** Alert users when experiments complete
6. **Advanced Filters:** More granular timeline filtering (date range picker)
7. **Annotation System:** Allow users to add notes to timeline events
8. **Comparison Mode:** Compare multiple experiments side-by-side
