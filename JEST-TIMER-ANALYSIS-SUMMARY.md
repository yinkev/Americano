## What Was Analyzed

### The Problem
Tests use `jest.useFakeTimers()` to prevent actual delays, but don't advance timers explicitly. This causes:
- Tests hang when retries trigger delays (~100ms - 30s delays)
- Inconsistent execution times (baseline >30s with timeouts)
- Some tests skip retries entirely due to blocked delays

### Retry Logic Under Test
```typescript
// From MockGraphBuilder.calculateBackoff()
exponentialBackoff = 100ms * 2^attempt (capped at 30,000ms)
jitter = 10% of delay
totalDelay = base + jitter
```

**Typical Delays:**
- Attempt 0: 100-110 ms
- Attempt 1: 200-220 ms
- Attempt 2: 400-440 ms
- Attempt 3: 800-880 ms
- Attempt 4+: 30,000-33,000 ms (capped)

## Key Findings

### Tests Requiring `jest.advanceTimersByTime()` (11 tests)

These tests trigger retry logic and MUST advance fake timers:

**Single Retry Tests (3 tests):**
1. Test #1 - Rate limit (429) → advance 150ms
2. Test #6 - Service unavailable (503) → advance 150ms
3. Test #14 - Retry logging → advance 150ms

**Multiple Retry Tests (5 tests):**
4. Test #2 - Max retries with retry-after → advance 30,150ms
5. Test #7 - Two failures then success → advance 400ms
6. Test #8 - Batch with mixed results → advance 150ms
7. Test #12 - Circuit breaker with retries → advance 800ms per loop
8. Test #18 - Exhaust all retries → advance 800ms

**No Advancement Needed Tests (5 tests):**
- Tests #3, #4, #5 - Permanent errors (JSON parsing, non-retriable)
- Tests #9, #10, #11 - No retriable conditions or utility tests only

**Real Timers Exception (2 tests):**
- Test #13 - Circuit breaker recovery timeout (already uses real timers ✓)
- Test #17 - Complete flow with real delays (already uses real timers ✓)

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Low Risk (8 tests, 45 minutes)
Tests with simple patterns, predictable delays:
- Tests #1, #3-6, #9-11, #14-16
- Changes: Add 150ms advancement to tests #1, #6, #14 only
- Risk: Very Low
- Confidence: 95%

### Phase 2: Medium Risk (5 tests, 60 minutes)
Tests with multiple retries or complex scenarios:
- Tests #2, #7, #8, #12, #18
- Changes: Add 400-800ms advancements (or 30,150ms for max scenario)
- Risk: Low-Medium
- Confidence: 85%

### Phase 3: Validation (2 tests, 30 minutes)
Circuit breaker and integration tests:
- Tests #13, #17 - Verify no changes needed (already use real timers)
- Risk: Very Low
- Confidence: 100%

**Total Time: 2-3 hours**

## Core Implementation Pattern

### Pattern for Tests WITH Retries
```typescript
// Start async operation
const promise = builder.extractConceptsFromChunk(chunk)

// Advance timers past retry delays
jest.advanceTimersByTime(150) // or calculated value

// Now await completion
await promise

// Assert expected behavior
expect(mockClient.client.chat.completions.create).toHaveBeenCalledTimes(2)
```

### Pattern for Tests WITHOUT Retries
```typescript
// No timer advancement needed - test stays as-is
await builder.extractConceptsFromChunk(chunk)

// Assert still works
expect(mockClient.client.chat.completions.create).toHaveBeenCalledTimes(1)
```

### Exception Pattern for Circuit Breaker Tests
```typescript
// These tests MUST use real timers (already implemented correctly)
jest.useRealTimers() // Line 683 in test #13, Line 778 in test #17

// Wait actual time for circuit breaker recovery
await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 150))
```

## Critical Decisions

### Decision 1: Keep Real Timers for Circuit Breaker Tests
**Decision:** Tests #13 and #17 continue using `jest.useRealTimers()`

**Rationale:**
- Circuit breaker timeout logic is time-critical
- Fake timers would mask actual timeout behavior
- These tests verify 150ms actual delay occurs
- Tests are already implemented correctly ✓

**Impact:**
- Tests #13 and #17 take actual ~200-300ms each
- Other 16 tests complete in <20ms each
- Total test suite time: <30 seconds (vs. 30s+ with hangs)

### Decision 2: Use Safe Advancement Values with Buffers
**Decision:** Add 40-100ms buffer to calculated delays

**Rationale:**
- Jitter adds 0-10% of delay
- Microtask scheduling adds minor delay
- Buffers prevent race conditions
- Safe > Optimal

**Impact:**
- 150ms instead of exact 110ms for 1 retry
- 400ms instead of exact 310ms for 2 retries
- Negligible performance impact (delays <500ms)

### Decision 3: Individual Timer Advancement Per Test
**Decision:** Each test advances its own needed delay (not jest.runAllTimers())

**Rationale:**
- Explicit advancement prevents masking bugs
- `jest.runAllTimers()` too aggressive (could be 30s+)
- Individual advancement is predictable and testable
- Easier to debug timer issues

**Impact:**
- More verbose code but clearer intent
- Prevents accidental test interactions
- Better for regression detection

## Risk Assessment Summary

| Category | Risk | Mitigation |
|----------|------|-----------|
| Tests hang/timeout | **CRITICAL** | Add explicit timer advancement to 11 tests |
| Incorrect delay values | HIGH | Calculate with buffers, test 3+ times each |
| Flaky tests | MEDIUM | Use safe advancement values, run 5x before merge |
| Coverage drops | MEDIUM | Verify coverage before/after merge |
| Circuit breaker tests fail | LOW | Already using real timers correctly |
| Permanent error tests fail | LOW | Correctly don't advance timers |

**Overall Risk Level: MEDIUM** (85% confidence of success)

## FAQ

### Q: Why not use `jest.runAllTimers()`?
A: Too aggressive - would run ALL timers (could be 30+ seconds). Explicit advancement prevents masking bugs and is more predictable.

### Q: Why do tests #13 and #17 use real timers?
A: Circuit breaker timeout logic needs actual delay. Fake timers would mask whether timeout is working correctly. These tests verify real-world behavior.

### Q: What if a test is still flaky after implementation?
A: Increase advancement buffer by 50-100ms. Verify no other timers are running. Check for race conditions in mock setup.

### Q: Can I use helper function for all timer advancements?
A: Yes! Recommended approach - see JEST-TIMER-IMPLEMENTATION-GUIDE.md for helper function example.

### Q: How do I test that my implementation is correct?
A: Follow JEST-TIMER-VERIFICATION-CHECKLIST.md - run tests 5+ times, verify coverage, check for flakiness.

### Q: Will this affect other test files?
A: No - changes are isolated to graph-builder-retry.test.ts. Other test files unchanged.
