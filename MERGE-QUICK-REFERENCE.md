## Critical Decision Points

### 1. Epic 3 Models
**Question:** Restore all 21 Epic 3 models?  
**Investigation Needed:**
- Are Epic 3 features in production?
- Does production DB have Epic 3 data?
- If yes â†’ MUST restore to prevent data loss

### 2. Model Renaming
**Question:** How to resolve BehavioralPattern/Insight conflicts?  
**Options:**
- Epic 4: Rename to `UnderstandingPattern` / `DailyUnderstandingInsight`
- Epic 5: Keep current names (preferred - more comprehensive)

### 3. Migration Strategy
**Question:** Single migration or staged approach?  
**Recommendation:** Single comprehensive migration after full reconciliation

## Recommended Merge Steps

```bash
# 1. Backup current Epic 5 schema
cp apps/web/prisma/schema.prisma /tmp/epic5-schema.backup

# 2. Create reconciliation branch
git checkout -b epic-5-main-reconciliation

# 3. Fetch latest main
git fetch origin main

# 4. Start merge (will conflict)
git merge origin/main

# 5. Resolve schema.prisma manually
# - Add Epic 3 models (if needed)
# - Add Epic 4 models
# - Keep Epic 5 models
# - Rename conflicts

# 6. Resolve package.json
# - Merge all dependencies
# - Keep all scripts

# 7. Resolve other files (straightforward)

# 8. Test migration
npx prisma migrate dev --name epic_3_4_5_reconciliation

# 9. Run tests
npm run test:integration

# 10. Commit and push
git add .
git commit -m "Merge main into Epic 5: Reconcile Epics 3, 4, 5"
git push origin epic-5-main-reconciliation
```
