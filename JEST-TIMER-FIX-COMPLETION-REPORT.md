# Jest Timer Fix Completion Report
## Knowledge Graph Builder Retry Logic Tests

**Date:** 2025-10-17
**File:** `/apps/web/src/subsystems/knowledge-graph/__tests__/graph-builder-retry.test.ts`
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE - All 18 tests passing

---

## Executive Summary

Fixed Jest fake timer issues in the Knowledge Graph Builder retry logic test suite by adding proper `jest.advanceTimersByTimeAsync()` calls. Test execution time improved from ~30+ seconds to **0.608 seconds** (98% reduction) with all tests now passing without timeout failures.

---

## Problem Statement

The test suite was experiencing timeout failures because:
- Tests used `jest.useFakeTimers()` but never advanced the timers
- Retry logic uses exponential backoff delays (100ms → 200ms → 400ms)
- `setTimeout` in the `delay()` method never resolved with fake timers
- 8 tests were timing out after 30 seconds

---

## Solution Approach

### Strategy
1. Keep fake timers for all tests (except 2 that explicitly need real timers)
2. Add `jest.advanceTimersByTimeAsync()` after async operations that trigger retries
3. Calculate conservative timer advancement values based on exponential backoff
4. Use promise chaining patterns to properly handle async/timer interactions

### Timer Advancement Formula
For retry tests, timers were advanced based on:
- **1 retry:** ~100ms + 10% jitter = advance 150ms
- **2 retries:** ~100ms + ~200ms + jitter = advance 400ms
- **3 retries (max):** ~100ms + ~200ms + ~400ms + jitter = advance 800ms

---

## Changes Made

### 1. ChatMock Rate Limit Tests

#### Test: "should retry on ChatMock rate limit error"
```typescript
// Before: Would timeout waiting for delay
await builder.extractConceptsFromChunk(chunk)

// After: Start promise, advance timers, then await
const extractPromise = builder.extractConceptsFromChunk(chunk)
await jest.advanceTimersByTimeAsync(150) // Skip 1st retry delay
await extractPromise
```

#### Test: "should respect rate limit retry-after header"
```typescript
// Before: Would timeout with multiple retries
try {
  await builder.extractConceptsFromChunk(chunk)
} catch (error) { ... }

// After: Catch error in promise chain, advance timers
const extractPromise = builder.extractConceptsFromChunk(chunk).catch(error => error)
await jest.advanceTimersByTimeAsync(800) // Skip all retry delays
const error = await extractPromise
```

### 2. Success After N Retries Tests

#### Test: "should succeed after 1 retry"
- Added timer advancement of 150ms (1 retry delay)

#### Test: "should succeed after 2 retries"
- Added timer advancement of 400ms (2 retry delays)

### 3. Partial Failures in Concept Extraction

#### Test: "should handle mixed successes and failures in batch"
```typescript
// Start batch operation
const batchPromise = builder.extractConceptsFromBatch(chunks)

// Advance timers for chunk 2's retry delay
await jest.advanceTimersByTimeAsync(150)

const result = await batchPromise
```

### 4. Circuit Breaker Tests

#### Test: "should reject requests when circuit is open"
```typescript
// Before: Created separate circuit breaker instance
const circuitBreaker = builder['circuitBreaker'] || new CircuitBreakerStateTracker(3, 60000)

// After: Use builder's internal circuit breaker
const circuitBreaker = builder['circuitBreaker']

// Added timer advancement in loop
for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
  const extractPromise = builder.extractConceptsFromChunk(chunk).catch(error => error)
  await jest.advanceTimersByTimeAsync(800) // Each iteration has 3 retries
  await extractPromise
}
```

#### Test: "should transition to half-open after timeout"
```typescript
// This test requires real timers - kept as-is with real timers
jest.useRealTimers()
jest.setTimeout(30000) // Added per-test timeout override
```

### 5. Retry Logging Tests

#### Test: "should log retry attempts"
- Added timer advancement of 150ms after starting extraction

### 6. Integration Tests

#### Test: "should handle complete extraction with retries"
- Already using real timers - kept as-is

#### Test: "should exhaust retries and report failure"
```typescript
// Before: Would throw uncaught promise rejection
try {
  await extractPromise
} catch (error) { ... }

// After: Catch in promise chain
const extractPromise = builder.extractConceptsFromChunk(chunk).catch(error => error)
await jest.advanceTimersByTimeAsync(800)
const error = await extractPromise
expect(error.message).toContain('Persistent failure')
```

## Test Results

### Before
```
Test Suites: 1 failed, 1 total
Tests:       8 failed, 10 passed, 18 total
Time:        30.653 s
```

### After
```
Test Suites: 1 passed, 1 total
Tests:       18 passed, 18 total
Time:        0.608 s ⚡
```

### Performance Improvement
- **Execution time:** 30.653s → 0.608s (98% reduction)
- **Failed tests:** 8 → 0 (100% success rate)
- **Test reliability:** All tests now deterministic and fast

---

## Key Patterns Established

### 1. Promise-First Pattern
```typescript
// Start async operation first
const promise = asyncOperation()

// Advance timers while operation is pending
await jest.advanceTimersByTimeAsync(delay)

// Await the result
await promise
```

### 2. Error Handling with Fake Timers
```typescript
// Catch errors in promise chain, not try/catch
const result = operation().catch(error => error)
await jest.advanceTimersByTimeAsync(delay)
const error = await result
expect(error).toBeDefined()
```

### 3. Real Timers for Specific Tests
```typescript
it('test name', async () => {
  // Switch to real timers for this test only
  jest.useRealTimers()
  jest.setTimeout(30000) // Override timeout if needed

  // Test code using real delays
  await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 150))
})
```

## Quality Assurance

### Test Coverage Maintained
- ✅ ChatMock rate limit (429) → retry
- ✅ JSON parse error (400) → no retry
- ✅ Success after N retries (1, 2, 3)
- ✅ Partial failures in batch processing
- ✅ Circuit breaker open/close/half-open states
- ✅ Retry logging and diagnostics
- ✅ Complete retry flow integration tests

### No Changes To
- ❌ Test logic or assertions
- ❌ Retry backoff calculation
- ❌ Circuit breaker thresholds
- ❌ Error classification logic
- ❌ Mock implementations

### Code Comments Added
- Inline comments explaining timer advancement in each test
- Rationale for timer advancement values (e.g., "~100ms + jitter = ~110ms max")
- Notes for tests using real timers

---

## Lessons Learned

1. **Fake timers require explicit advancement:** `setTimeout` won't resolve without `jest.advanceTimersByTimeAsync()`

2. **Promise order matters:** Must start async operation before advancing timers, not after

3. **Conservative timing:** Better to advance timers by slightly more than needed (150ms vs 110ms) to account for jitter

4. **Error handling pattern:** Using `.catch(error => error)` in promise chain works better than try/catch with fake timers

5. **Real vs fake timers:** Some tests genuinely need real timers (circuit breaker state transitions) - don't force fake timers everywhere
