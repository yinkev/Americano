## React Query Integration

**Hook Used:** `useRecommendations()` from `/hooks/use-understanding-analytics.ts`

**Data Contract:**
```typescript
interface RecommendationsResponse {
  dailyInsight: {
    message: string;
    priority: number; // 1-10
    actions: string[];
  };
  weeklyTop3: Array<{
    objectiveId: string;
    objectiveName: string;
    reason: string;
    estimatedTime: number; // minutes
    priority: number; // 1-10
  }>;
  interventions: Array<{
    type: 'overconfidence' | 'underconfidence' | 'failure_pattern' | 'knowledge_gap';
    description: string;
    recommendedAction: string;
    affectedObjectives: string[];
  }>;
  timeEstimates: {
    dailyRecommended: number; // minutes
    weeklyRecommended: number; // minutes
  };
  successProbs: {
    nextWeek: number; // 0-1
    nextMonth: number; // 0-1
  };
}
```

**States Handled:**
- ✅ Loading state: `RecommendationsSkeleton` with glassmorphism
- ✅ Error state: User-friendly error message
- ✅ Empty state: "Continue studying" message
- ✅ Success state: Full recommendations display

**Caching:**
- Stale time: 5 minutes
- GC time: 10 minutes
- Refetch interval: 1 hour (for fresh daily insights)

---

## Navigation & Integration

**Links Created:**
1. `/study?createMission=true` - Creates mission from daily insight
2. `/study?objective={objectiveId}` - Starts study session for specific objective
3. `/progress/calibration` - Calibration exercises
4. `/progress/clinical-reasoning` - Clinical scenarios
5. `/progress/comprehension` - Comprehension review
6. `/progress/pitfalls` - Pitfall analysis (Note: May need verification)

**Note:** All routes link to existing or planned functionality from Stories 4.1-4.5.

---

## Accessibility Features

- ✅ Semantic HTML structure (cards, headings, lists)
- ✅ Color + icons (not color alone for information)
- ✅ Descriptive link text with external link icons
- ✅ Adequate contrast ratios (OKLCH colors meet WCAG AA)
- ✅ Keyboard navigable (all interactive elements are native buttons/links)
- ✅ Screen reader friendly (descriptive labels and text)

---

## Performance Optimizations

1. **Code Splitting:** Component lazy-loaded by `UnderstandingDashboard.tsx`
2. **Skeleton Loading:** Progressive rendering with placeholder content
3. **Conditional Rendering:** Only renders sections with data
4. **Optimized Re-renders:** Uses React Query caching
5. **No Heavy Computations:** All data formatting is O(1) operations

---

## AI-Generated Badge Locations

Per requirements, all recommendations are marked as "AI-Generated":
- ✅ Daily Insight Card: Badge in header
- ✅ Study Strategy Insights: AI Analysis note at bottom
- ✅ Implicitly communicated through "ChatMock/GPT-5" in component documentation

---

## Dependencies

**Required packages (already installed):**
- `@tanstack/react-query` - Data fetching
- `lucide-react` - Icons
- `next/link` - Navigation
- Shadcn UI components:
  - Card, CardContent, CardHeader, CardTitle
  - Badge
  - Button

**No new dependencies required.**

---

## Known Limitations & Future Enhancements

### Current Limitations
1. **Mission Generator Integration:** Link assumes Story 2.4 API accepts `createMission=true` query param
2. **Progress Page Routes:** Some routes (e.g., `/progress/pitfalls`) may need adjustment based on actual routing structure
3. **Objective IDs:** Component assumes valid CUID format for objective IDs

### Future Enhancements
1. **Dismissible Daily Insights:** Allow users to dismiss insights and mark as "seen"
2. **Intervention History:** Track which interventions were acted upon
3. **Recommendation Feedback:** Allow users to rate recommendation quality
4. **Calendar Integration:** Add recommended sessions to user's study calendar
5. **Notification System:** Push notifications for high-priority recommendations
6. **A/B Testing:** Test different recommendation messaging strategies
