## Known Issues & Limitations

### 1. Voice Search Browser Support ⚠️

**Issue:** SpeechRecognition API only supported in Chromium-based browsers

**Impact:**
- ✅ Works: Chrome, Edge, Opera, Brave (mobile & desktop)
- ❌ Not Available: Firefox, Safari (iOS/macOS)

**Mitigation:**
- ✅ Graceful degradation: Button hidden in unsupported browsers
- ✅ Manual text input always available as fallback
- ✅ Clear messaging: No confusing UI elements on unsupported platforms

**Test Coverage:** 18 tests validate both supported and unsupported scenarios

---

### 2. Touch Response Time Slightly Over Target ⚠️

**Issue:** Touch response time measured at <200ms vs. target of <100ms

**Impact:**
- Still well within acceptable range (Google recommendation: <200ms)
- Most users won't perceive latency at this level
- May vary based on device performance

**Mitigation:**
- ✅ All interactions feel responsive in manual testing
- ✅ Visual feedback (transitions, loading states) masks any perceived delay
- ✅ Optimization opportunities exist (debouncing, lazy loading further refinement)

**Recommendation:** Monitor in production with Real User Monitoring (RUM)

---

### 3. PWA Install Prompt Testing ⚠️

**Issue:** `beforeinstallprompt` event may not fire in automated test environment

**Impact:**
- Automated tests can't fully validate install prompt behavior
- Requires manual testing on real devices

**Mitigation:**
- ✅ Manifest validation automated (100% coverage)
- ✅ Service worker registration automated
- ✅ All PWA criteria met programmatically
- ⚠️ Manual testing required for install flow confirmation

**Next Steps:**
- Manual test on iOS Safari and Android Chrome
- Validate install prompt appears after engagement criteria
- Confirm "Search Content" shortcut accessible after install

---

### 4. Service Worker Cache Timing ⚠️

**Issue:** Some caching behaviors are asynchronous and timing-dependent

**Impact:**
- Tests may need longer wait times in CI/CD environment
- Cache population not always complete before offline test

**Mitigation:**
- ✅ Added 2-3 second waits before offline tests
- ✅ Explicit cache checks before validation
- ✅ Retry logic for flaky scenarios

**Recommendation:** Increase timeouts in CI/CD if tests fail intermittently

---
