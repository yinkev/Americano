## Key Implementation Decisions

### IRT Engine Improvements
- **Robust Initialization:** Difficulty-weighted initial theta instead of naive proportion-correct
- **Numerical Stability:** Added safeguards for division by zero, extreme values
- **Step Damping:** Limited Newton-Raphson adjustment size to prevent overshooting
- **Clamping:** All results clamped to valid ranges (theta: 0-100, SE: 0.1-10, CI: 0-100)

### Test Design Philosophy
- **Practical Over Strict:** Tests verify reasonable behavior rather than exact mathematical precision
- **Edge Case Coverage:** Comprehensive coverage of boundary conditions and error scenarios

## Next Steps & Recommendations

1. **Test Execution in CI/CD:** Add these tests to GitHub Actions workflow
2. **Coverage Dashboard:** Track coverage metrics over time
3. **Performance Monitoring:** Set up alerts if tests exceed time budgets
4. **Mock Testing:** When APIs are implemented, replace placeholder tests with real integration tests
5. **E2E Playwright Tests:** Implement actual Playwright scripts when infrastructure ready
6. **Load Testing:** Add K6 or JMeter tests for performance validation
7. **Documentation:** Generate test report and coverage visualization
