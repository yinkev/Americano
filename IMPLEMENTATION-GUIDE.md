---

## Step-by-Step Implementation

### Step 1: Apply Database Migration (1 minute)

```bash
cd /Users/kyin/Projects/Americano-epic3/apps/web

# Create the migration files
npx prisma migrate dev

# Verify migration applied
npx prisma migrate status
```

**Expected output:**
```
✓ Migration 20251017_optimize_cooccurrence_indexes applied successfully
```

**What was created:**
- `pg_trgm` extension for substring matching
- 4 new indexes for optimized queries
- No schema changes, only performance enhancements

### Step 2: Update Code (2 minutes)

**File**: `/Users/kyin/Projects/Americano-epic3/apps/web/src/subsystems/knowledge-graph/graph-builder.ts`

**Action**: Replace the `detectCoOccurrence` method (lines 349-383)

**Current code to find** (lines 349-383):
```typescript
private async detectCoOccurrence(concepts: Concept[]): Promise<DetectedRelationship[]> {
  const relationships: DetectedRelationship[] = []

  for (let i = 0; i < concepts.length; i++) {
    for (let j = i + 1; j < concepts.length; j++) {
      // ... problematic nested loops
    }
  }

  return relationships
}
```

**Replacement code**: Copy from `/Users/kyin/Projects/Americano-epic3/OPTIMIZED-DETECTCOOCCURRENCE.ts`

**What to copy**:
```typescript
/**
 * REPLACE THIS ENTIRE METHOD in graph-builder.ts
 *
 * Detect co-occurrence relationships from shared content chunks
 * OPTIMIZED: Single atomic PostgreSQL query instead of O(n²) individual queries
 */
async detectCoOccurrence(concepts: Concept[]): Promise<DetectedRelationship[]> {
  if (concepts.length < 2) {
    this.log('Skipping co-occurrence detection: fewer than 2 concepts')
    return []
  }

  const relationships: DetectedRelationship[] = []
  const coOccurrenceThreshold = this.config.coOccurrenceThreshold

  try {
    // OPTIMIZED: Single atomic query instead of O(n²) individual queries
    const coOccurrences = await prisma.$queryRaw<CoOccurrenceResult[]>`
      SELECT
        c1.id AS concept1_id,
        c1.name AS concept1_name,
        c2.id AS concept2_id,
        c2.name AS concept2_name,
        COUNT(DISTINCT cc.id)::int AS co_occurrence_count
      FROM
        concepts c1
        CROSS JOIN concepts c2
        JOIN content_chunks cc ON (
          cc.content ILIKE '%' || c1.name || '%'
          AND cc.content ILIKE '%' || c2.name || '%'
        )
      WHERE
        c1.id < c2.id
        AND cc."lectureId" IN (
          SELECT id FROM lectures WHERE "processingStatus" = 'COMPLETED'
        )
      GROUP BY
        c1.id, c1.name, c2.id, c2.name
      HAVING
        COUNT(DISTINCT cc.id) >= ${coOccurrenceThreshold}
      ORDER BY
        co_occurrence_count DESC
    `

    // Convert query results to DetectedRelationship objects
    for (const result of coOccurrences) {
      const strength = Math.min(result.co_occurrence_count / 10, 1) * 0.3

      relationships.push({
        fromConceptId: result.concept1_id,
        toConceptId: result.concept2_id,
        relationship: RelationshipType.INTEGRATED,
        strength,
      })
    }

    this.log(
      `Co-occurrence detection complete: found ${relationships.length} relationships`
    )
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error detecting co-occurrences:', error)
  }

  return relationships
}

interface CoOccurrenceResult {
  concept1_id: string
  concept1_name: string
  concept2_id: string
  concept2_name: string
  co_occurrence_count: number
}
```

### Step 3: TypeScript Compilation Check (1 minute)

```bash
cd /Users/kyin/Projects/Americano-epic3/apps/web

# Verify no TypeScript errors
pnpm build

# Expected: No errors, build succeeds
```

### Step 4: Test the Changes (1 minute)

```bash
# Run unit tests for graph builder
pnpm test graph-builder

# Run integration tests
pnpm test:integration

# Expected: All tests pass
```

---

## Performance Validation

### Before Optimization (Current State)

```typescript
// Current O(n²) implementation
for (let i = 0; i < concepts.length; i++) {
  for (let j = i + 1; j < concepts.length; j++) {
    // Individual query per pair
    const count = await prisma.contentChunk.count({ ... })
  }
}

// For 1000 concepts:
// Queries: 499,500
// Time: ~2,497.5 seconds (41.6 minutes!)
// Connection pool: EXHAUSTED (max ~10-20 connections)
```

### After Optimization (New Implementation)

```typescript
// Optimized single-query implementation
const coOccurrences = await prisma.$queryRaw<CoOccurrenceResult[]>`
  SELECT ... FROM concepts c1 CROSS JOIN concepts c2 JOIN content_chunks ...
`

// For 1000 concepts:
// Queries: 1
// Time: ~2-3 seconds
// Connection pool: 1 connection used
```

### Expected Metrics

Run this test to verify performance:

```typescript
// File: apps/web/src/__tests__/performance/cooccurrence-performance.test.ts

describe('Co-occurrence Detection - Performance', () => {
  it('should detect co-occurrences in <5 seconds for 1000 concepts', async () => {
    const builder = new KnowledgeGraphBuilder({
      coOccurrenceThreshold: 3,
      verbose: true,
    })

    // Create 100+ test concepts
    const concepts = await createTestConcepts(100)

    const start = Date.now()
    const relationships = await builder.detectCoOccurrence(concepts)
    const duration = Date.now() - start

    console.log(`✓ Detected ${relationships.length} relationships in ${duration}ms`)

    // Performance assertions
    expect(duration).toBeLessThan(5000) // Must complete in <5 seconds
    expect(relationships).toBeDefined()
  })
})
```

---

## Troubleshooting

### Issue 1: Migration fails with "Extension already exists"

**Solution**: This is normal. PostgreSQL prevents duplicate extensions.

```sql
-- The migration includes: CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS pg_trgm;
-- This safely handles existing extensions
```

### Issue 2: Query times still slow (>5 seconds)

**Causes & Solutions**:

1. **Indexes not used** → Analyze tables
   ```sql
   ANALYZE content_chunks;
   ANALYZE lectures;
   ANALYZE concepts;
   ```

2. **No COMPLETED lectures** → Check data
   ```sql
   SELECT COUNT(*) FROM lectures WHERE "processingStatus" = 'COMPLETED';
   ```

3. **Large content chunks** → Queries must scan more text
   - This is normal with large datasets
   - Consider materializing view for repeated queries (optional optimization)

### Issue 3: "Unsupported type" errors

**Cause**: The `$queryRaw` needs explicit type casting for `Unsupported` types like `vector`

**Solution**: The optimized query doesn't query vector fields, so this shouldn't occur. If it does:

```typescript
// Make sure you're not selecting embedding columns
SELECT c1.id, c1.name, -- OK: scalar columns
       -- cc.embedding,  -- DON'T SELECT unsupported types
       COUNT(...) AS count
FROM ...
```

### Issue 4: PostgreSQL error "column must appear in GROUP BY"

**Cause**: Incorrect GROUP BY clause

**Solution**: The provided SQL is correct. If you modify it, ensure all non-aggregated columns are in GROUP BY:

```sql
-- CORRECT
GROUP BY c1.id, c1.name, c2.id, c2.name

-- INCORRECT (would cause error)
GROUP BY c1.id, c2.id  -- Missing c1.name, c2.name
```

---

## Monitoring After Deployment

### Track Query Performance

Add to logging system:

```typescript
const startTime = Date.now()
const relationships = await builder.identifyRelationships(concepts)
const duration = Date.now() - startTime

if (duration > 5000) {
  console.warn(`[SLOW] Co-occurrence detection took ${duration}ms (expected: <3000ms)`)
  // Alert monitoring system
}
```

### PostgreSQL Query Insights

```sql
-- Monitor co-occurrence queries
SELECT
  query,
  calls,
  mean_exec_time,
  total_exec_time
FROM pg_stat_statements
WHERE query ILIKE '%co_occurrence%' OR query ILIKE '%CROSS JOIN%'
ORDER BY total_exec_time DESC;
```

### Connection Pool Health

```typescript
// Monitor connection pool (if using pgBouncer or connection pool)
const poolStatus = await prisma.$queryRaw`SELECT * FROM pg_stat_activity WHERE query LIKE '%content_chunks%'`
console.log(`Active connections: ${poolStatus.length}`)
// Should be <= 1 after optimization (was 10+ before)
```

---

## Rollback Plan

If issues arise after deployment:

### Option 1: Revert Code Only (1 minute)

```bash
git revert <commit-hash>  # Revert to old detectCoOccurrence method

# Fallback to old Prisma queries (slower but working)
# No data loss, graph still builds (just slower)
```

### Option 2: Revert Everything (2 minutes)

```bash
# Revert both code and migration
git revert --no-edit <migration-commit>
git revert --no-edit <code-commit>

# Apply reversions
npx prisma migrate dev

# Roll back indexes (optional, they don't hurt if left)
DROP INDEX idx_content_chunks_content_trgm;
DROP INDEX idx_lectures_processing_status;
DROP INDEX idx_content_chunks_lecture_composite;
```

### Data Safety

**No data is at risk**:
- This is a read-only query (no INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE)
- Indexes only affect query performance, not data
- Reverting simply restores old query patterns
- Graph relationships remain intact

---

## Next Steps After Implementation

### 1. Monitor in Staging (1 day)

```bash
# Deploy to staging first
git push origin feature/epic-3-knowledge-graph

# Run staging tests
pnpm test:integration

# Monitor performance
# Expected: <5 seconds for co-occurrence detection
```

### 2. Production Deployment (with monitoring)

```bash
# Merge to main
git checkout main
git merge feature/epic-3-knowledge-graph

# Deploy with alerts configured
# Monitor: pg_stat_statements for query times
# Alert if duration > 10 seconds (warning) or > 30 seconds (critical)
```

### 3. Future Optimizations (Optional)

Once this optimization is live, consider:

1. **Materialized View** for frequently-repeated queries
2. **Incremental Updates** for new content only
3. **Vector-based Co-occurrence** using pgvector embeddings
4. **Caching Layer** for 24-hour TTL

## Questions & Support

### Why CROSS JOIN instead of UNION or subqueries?

PostgreSQL's query planner handles CROSS JOIN + GROUP BY more efficiently for this use case. It:
- Calculates all pairs within the query engine
- Uses indexes effectively for content matching
- Aggregates results in a single pass

### Why ILIKE instead of full-text search?

ILIKE (case-insensitive LIKE) is appropriate here because:
- Concept names are typically 2-10 words (not documents)
- We need substring matching (exact concept name in content)
- FTS would require stemming which might miss exact matches
- Performance is comparable with trigram indexes

### Why COUNT(DISTINCT cc.id) instead of COUNT(*)?

- COUNT(*) would count duplicate rows from GROUP BY
- COUNT(DISTINCT cc.id) counts unique chunks
- Example: If chunk appears twice in result set, COUNT(*) = 2, COUNT(DISTINCT) = 1

### Can I adjust the co-occurrence threshold?

Yes! In `graph-builder.ts`:

```typescript
// Line 76-80: Adjust in constructor
this.config = {
  coOccurrenceThreshold: config.coOccurrenceThreshold ?? 3, // Change 3 to any value
  // ...
}

// Or when instantiating:
const builder = new KnowledgeGraphBuilder({ coOccurrenceThreshold: 5 })
```
