 ⚠ Invalid next.config.js options detected:

 ⚠ See more info here: https://nextjs.org/docs/messages/invalid-next-config
 ⚠ The `devIndicators` option `buildActivityPosition` ("bottom-right") conflicts with `position` ("bottom-left"). Using `buildActivityPosition` ("bottom-right") for backward compatibility.
 ⚠ Warning: Next.js inferred your workspace root, but it may not be correct.
 We detected multiple lockfiles and selected the directory of /Users/kyin/pnpm-lock.yaml as the root directory.
 To silence this warning, set `outputFileTracingRoot` in your Next.js config, or consider removing one of the lockfiles if it's not needed.
   See https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/config/next-config-js/output#caveats for more information.
 Detected additional lockfiles: 
   * /Users/kyin/Projects/Americano-epic5/apps/web/pnpm-lock.yaml
