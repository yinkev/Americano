   - Actual voice input requires real microphone (mocked in tests)

2. **PWA Install Prompt:**
   - `beforeinstallprompt` event may not fire in test environment
   - Requires real browser usage to test installation flow

3. **Service Worker:**
   - Some caching behaviors are asynchronous and timing-dependent
   - Tests may need to wait for cache population
