## Troubleshooting Guide

### Issue: Tests Timeout
```bash

```

### Issue: Graph Doesn't Render
- Verify BASE_URL: `http://localhost:3000`
- Check React Flow CSS import
- Review mock data structure
- Enable debug logs: `DEBUG=pw:api`

### Issue: PDF Upload Fails
- Ensure `e2e/fixtures/` exists
- Check file permissions
- Verify OCR service (if not mocked)

### Issue: Slow Performance
- Check database indexes
- Verify Gemini API quota
- Monitor system resources
- Profile with Chrome DevTools
