### Feature Engineering Pipeline

The `StruggleFeatureExtractor` implements a comprehensive feature engineering system with **15 normalized features** (0-1 scale):

#### Performance Features (5 features)
- `retention_score`: Average retention for topic area (last 30 days)
- `retention_decline_rate`: Rate of retention degradation over time
- `review_lapse_rate`: Frequency of AGAIN ratings
- `session_performance_score`: Recent session performance
- `validation_score`: Validation prompt average scores

#### Prerequisite Features (2 features)
- `prerequisite_gap_count`: Ratio of unmastered prerequisites
- `prerequisite_mastery_gap`: Average mastery gap for prerequisites

#### Complexity Features (2 features)
- `content_complexity`: Objective difficulty level (BASIC/INTERMEDIATE/ADVANCED)
- `complexity_mismatch`: Difficulty vs. user ability gap

#### Behavioral Features (3 features)
- `historical_struggle_score`: Past struggles in similar topics
- `content_type_mismatch`: Content format vs. learning style
- `cognitive_load_indicator`: Current cognitive load level

#### Contextual Features (3 features)
- `days_until_exam`: Urgency factor (normalized)
- `days_since_last_study`: Recency (normalized)
- `workload_level`: Current workload (normalized)

### Prediction Models

The system provides **two model implementations**:

#### 1. Rule-Based Model (MVP)
- **Type:** Threshold-based decision rules
- **Advantages:** Interpretable, no training data required, fast
- **Use Case:** Cold-start scenarios, when <50 training examples

**Decision Logic:**
- **High Risk (>0.7):** Retention <50% OR 50%+ prerequisites unmastered OR complexity mismatch >0.6 OR historical struggle >0.7
- **Medium Risk (0.4-0.7):** Retention 50-70% OR 20%+ prerequisites unmastered OR content type mismatch OR cognitive overload
- **Low Risk (<0.4):** None of the above conditions met

#### 2. Logistic Regression Model (Post-MVP)
- **Type:** Supervised machine learning (scikit-learn)
- **Algorithm:** Logistic Regression with L2 regularization
- **Solver:** SAGA (optimized for large datasets)
- **Calibration:** Sigmoid calibration via `CalibratedClassifierCV`
- **Class Balancing:** Automatic via `class_weight='balanced'`

**Training Pipeline:**
1. 80/20 train-test split (stratified)
2. Feature scaling with `StandardScaler`
3. L2 regularization to prevent overfitting
4. Probability calibration for reliable confidence scores
5. Comprehensive evaluation metrics

### Performance Targets

As specified in Story 5.2:
- **Accuracy:** >75%
- **Recall:** >70% (prioritize catching struggles)
- **Precision:** >65%
- **Calibration:** Predicted probability ±10% of actual rate

### Caching Strategy

3-tier caching for performance optimization:
- **L1 Cache:** User learning profile (1 hour TTL)
- **L2 Cache:** Behavioral patterns (12 hour TTL)
- **L3 Cache:** Performance metrics (30 minute TTL)

## Usage

### Basic Usage (Rule-Based Model)

```python
from ml import StruggleFeatureExtractor, StrugglePredictionModel

# Initialize components
extractor = StruggleFeatureExtractor(db_client)
model = StrugglePredictionModel()

# Extract features
features = await extractor.extract_features_for_objective(
    user_id="user_123",
    objective_id="obj_456"
)

# Predict struggle probability
prediction = model.predict(features)

print(f"Probability: {prediction.probability:.2f}")
print(f"Risk Level: {prediction.risk_level}")
print(f"Reasoning: {prediction.reasoning}")
```

### Advanced Usage (Trained ML Model)

```python
from ml import (
    StruggleFeatureExtractor,
    StrugglePredictionModel,
    TrainingExample
)

# Prepare training data
training_data = []
for user_id, objective_id, struggled in historical_data:
    features = await extractor.extract_features_for_objective(
        user_id, objective_id
    )
    training_data.append(TrainingExample(
        features=features,
        struggled=struggled,
        user_id=user_id,
        objective_id=objective_id,
        recorded_at=datetime.utcnow()
    ))

# Train model
model = StrugglePredictionModel(model_version="v1.0")
metrics = model.train(training_data, test_size=0.2, calibrate=True)

# Evaluate performance
print(f"Accuracy: {metrics.accuracy:.3f}")
print(f"Precision: {metrics.precision:.3f}")
print(f"Recall: {metrics.recall:.3f}")
print(f"F1 Score: {metrics.f1_score:.3f}")
print(f"AUC-ROC: {metrics.auc_roc:.3f}")

# Save trained model
model.save("models/struggle_prediction_v1.pkl")

# Later: Load and use
model = StrugglePredictionModel.load("models/struggle_prediction_v1.pkl")
prediction = model.predict(features)
```

### Incremental Learning

```python
# Update model with new feedback data
new_examples = [...]  # New training examples from user feedback
update_metrics = model.update_model(new_examples)

print(f"Updated Accuracy: {update_metrics.accuracy:.3f}")
```

### Feature Importance Analysis

```python
# Get feature importance scores
importance = extractor.calculate_feature_importance(training_data)

# Display top features
for feature, score in sorted(importance.items(), key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)[:5]:
    print(f"{feature}: {score:.3f}")

# Or from trained model
model_importance = model.feature_importance
```

## Feature Engineering Rationale

### Why These Features?

Each feature category addresses specific aspects of learning struggle prediction:

#### Performance Features
- **Retention metrics** directly measure knowledge retention, the core indicator of mastery
- **Review patterns** reveal struggling behaviors (frequent lapses = struggling)
- **Session/validation scores** provide real-time performance signals

#### Prerequisite Features
- **Medical education** is highly hierarchical (can't learn ECG interpretation without understanding cardiac anatomy)
- **Gap detection** identifies fundamental knowledge holes that predict future struggles

#### Complexity Features
- **Zone of Proximal Development** principle: struggle occurs when content exceeds learner's current ability
- **Mismatch detection** quantifies this gap

#### Behavioral Features
- **Learning styles** matter: visual learners struggle with text-heavy content
- **Historical patterns** are predictive: past struggles in physiology predict future physiology struggles
- **Cognitive load** affects learning capacity

#### Contextual Features
- **Temporal urgency** (exam proximity) increases stress and affects performance
- **Recency** influences retention and recall
- **Workload** impacts available cognitive resources

### Normalization Approach

All features normalized to **0-1 scale** for:
1. **Model stability:** Prevents feature dominance due to scale differences
2. **Interpretability:** 0 = minimum risk, 1 = maximum risk
3. **Transferability:** Works across different courses and users

### Missing Value Strategy

Default to **0.5 (neutral)** when data unavailable because:
- Avoids bias toward risk or safety
- Maintains data quality score to reflect uncertainty
- Allows model to function with partial data (graceful degradation)

## Model Evaluation

### Metrics Explained

- **Accuracy:** Overall correctness (both struggles and non-struggles)
- **Precision:** When we predict struggle, how often correct? (avoid false alarms)
- **Recall:** Of actual struggles, how many caught? (minimize missed struggles)
- **F1 Score:** Harmonic mean of precision and recall
- **AUC-ROC:** Model's ability to discriminate strugglers from non-strugglers
- **Calibration Curve:** Are predicted probabilities reliable? (e.g., 70% predictions actually struggle 70% of time)

### Why Prioritize Recall?

**Target:** Recall >70% (more important than precision >65%)

**Rationale:**
- **Cost asymmetry:** Missing a struggle (false negative) is worse than a false alarm (false positive)
- **Medical education stakes:** Failing to identify struggling students can lead to board exam failure
- **Intervention cost:** Proactive support is low-cost (vs. remediation after failure)

### Calibration Importance

Well-calibrated probabilities enable:
- **Risk stratification:** Confidently assign high/medium/low risk levels
- **Decision thresholds:** Set intervention triggers based on reliable probabilities
- **User trust:** Predictions match reality, building confidence in system

## Production Considerations

### Database Integration

The current implementation includes placeholders for database access. To integrate with Prisma:

```python
# Replace NotImplementedError methods with Prisma queries
async def _get_retention_data(self, user_id, topic_area, days):
    return await self.db.performanceMetric.findMany(
        where={
            'userId': user_id,
            'learningObjective': {
                'lecture': {'topicTags': {'has': topic_area}}
            },
            'date': {'gte': datetime.utcnow() - timedelta(days=days)}
        },
        select={'retentionScore': True, 'date': True}
    )
```

### Error Handling

```python
try:
    features = await extractor.extract_features_for_objective(user_id, obj_id)
    prediction = model.predict(features)
except ValueError as e:
    # Handle insufficient data
    logger.warning(f"Prediction failed: {e}")
    prediction = create_default_prediction()
except Exception as e:
    # Handle unexpected errors
    logger.error(f"Unexpected error: {e}")
    raise
```

### Model Versioning

Track model versions for reproducibility:
```python
model_v1 = StrugglePredictionModel(model_version="v1.0")
model_v1.train(training_data)
model_v1.save("models/struggle_v1.0_2025-10-16.pkl")

# Later: Compare versions
model_v2 = StrugglePredictionModel(model_version="v2.0")
metrics_v1 = model_v1.evaluate(test_data)
metrics_v2 = model_v2.evaluate(test_data)
```

### Monitoring

Track model performance in production:
```python
# Weekly evaluation
weekly_predictions = get_predictions_last_week()
weekly_actuals = get_actual_outcomes_last_week()

drift_metrics = model.evaluate(weekly_predictions, weekly_actuals)

if drift_metrics.accuracy < model.TARGET_ACCURACY:
    alert_team("Model accuracy degraded - retraining recommended")
```

## Testing

### Unit Tests

```python
def test_feature_extraction():
    extractor = StruggleFeatureExtractor(mock_db)
    features = await extractor.extract_features_for_objective("user1", "obj1")

    assert 0 <= features.retention_score <= 1
    assert 0 <= features.data_quality <= 1
    assert len(features.to_array()) == 15

def test_rule_based_prediction():
    model = StrugglePredictionModel()

    # High risk case
    high_risk_features = create_high_risk_features()
    prediction = model.predict(high_risk_features)
    assert prediction.probability >= 0.7
    assert prediction.risk_level == "HIGH"

    # Low risk case
    low_risk_features = create_low_risk_features()
    prediction = model.predict(low_risk_features)
    assert prediction.probability < 0.4
    assert prediction.risk_level == "LOW"
```

### Integration Tests

```python
async def test_end_to_end_prediction():
    # Setup
    db = create_test_database()
    extractor = StruggleFeatureExtractor(db)
    model = StrugglePredictionModel()

    # Extract features
    features = await extractor.extract_features_for_objective(
        "test_user", "test_objective"
    )

    # Predict
    prediction = model.predict(features)

    # Verify
    assert isinstance(prediction, PredictionResult)
    assert 0 <= prediction.probability <= 1
    assert prediction.risk_level in ["LOW", "MEDIUM", "HIGH"]
```
