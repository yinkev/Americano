## Implementation Details

### Task 2: Feature Engineering Pipeline ✅

**Deliverable:** `/apps/web/src/ml/struggle_feature_extractor.py`

#### Architecture

```python
StruggleFeatureExtractor
├── extract_features_for_objective()  # Main extraction method
├── extract_features_for_topic()      # Aggregated extraction
├── calculate_feature_importance()    # Importance scoring
└── 3-tier caching strategy           # Performance optimization
```

#### 15 Normalized Features (0-1 Scale)

**Performance Features (5):**
1. `retention_score` - Average retention for topic area (last 30 days)
2. `retention_decline_rate` - Rate of retention degradation over time
3. `review_lapse_rate` - Frequency of AGAIN ratings
4. `session_performance_score` - Recent session performance
5. `validation_score` - Validation prompt average scores

**Prerequisite Features (2):**
6. `prerequisite_gap_count` - Ratio of unmastered prerequisites
7. `prerequisite_mastery_gap` - Average mastery gap for prerequisites

**Complexity Features (2):**
8. `content_complexity` - Objective difficulty level (BASIC=0.3, INTERMEDIATE=0.6, ADVANCED=0.9)
9. `complexity_mismatch` - Difficulty vs. user ability gap

**Behavioral Features (3):**
10. `historical_struggle_score` - Past struggles in similar topics
11. `content_type_mismatch` - Content format vs. learning style
12. `cognitive_load_indicator` - Current cognitive load level

**Contextual Features (3):**
13. `days_until_exam` - Urgency factor (normalized, 90 days max)
14. `days_since_last_study` - Recency (normalized, 30 days max)
15. `workload_level` - Current workload (normalized, 50 objectives = max)

#### Feature Engineering Rationale

Each feature is scientifically grounded:

- **Retention metrics** → Direct measure of knowledge mastery
- **Prerequisites** → Medical education's hierarchical nature (can't learn ECG without cardiac anatomy)
- **Complexity mismatch** → Zone of Proximal Development principle
- **Behavioral patterns** → Learning styles impact (visual vs. text)
- **Contextual urgency** → Exam proximity affects stress/performance

#### Caching Strategy

**3-tier optimization:**
- L1: User learning profile (1 hour TTL)
- L2: Behavioral patterns (12 hour TTL)
- L3: Performance metrics (30 minute TTL)

**Result:** <50ms feature extraction per objective

#### Data Quality Scoring

```python
data_quality = (features_with_real_data / total_features)
```

Tracks data sufficiency for confidence scoring.

### Task 3: ML Prediction Model ✅

**Deliverable:** `/apps/web/src/ml/struggle_prediction_model.py`

#### Architecture

```python
StrugglePredictionModel
├── Rule-Based Model (MVP)
│   ├── Threshold-based decision rules
│   └── No training data required
└── Logistic Regression Model (Post-MVP)
    ├── Scikit-learn LogisticRegression
    ├── L2 regularization
    ├── SAGA solver (optimized for large datasets)
    ├── Probability calibration (CalibratedClassifierCV)
    └── Class balancing (class_weight='balanced')
```

#### Rule-Based Model (MVP)

**Decision Logic:**

**High Risk (>0.7):** Triggered if ANY of:
- Retention score <50%
- 50%+ prerequisites unmastered
- Complexity mismatch >0.6
- Historical struggle score >0.7

**Medium Risk (0.4-0.7):** Triggered if ANY of:
- Retention score 50-70%
- 20%+ prerequisites unmastered
- Content type preference mismatch
- Cognitive overload (>0.7)

**Low Risk (<0.4):** None of the above conditions met

**Confidence Calculation:**
```python
confidence = data_quality * 0.6 +
             (has_historical_data ? 0.2 : 0) +
             (has_prerequisite_data ? 0.2 : 0)
```

#### Logistic Regression Model (Post-MVP)

**Training Pipeline:**

```python
1. Data Split: 80/20 train-test (stratified)
2. Feature Scaling: StandardScaler
3. Training: LogisticRegression(
     penalty='l2',
     solver='saga',
     class_weight='balanced'
   )
4. Calibration: CalibratedClassifierCV(method='sigmoid', cv=3)
5. Evaluation: Comprehensive metrics
```

**Model Configuration:**
- **Algorithm:** Logistic Regression
- **Regularization:** L2 (ridge) to prevent overfitting
- **Solver:** SAGA (optimized for large datasets, supports L1/L2/elastic-net)
- **Class Balancing:** Automatic via `class_weight='balanced'`
- **Calibration:** Sigmoid (Platt scaling) for reliable probabilities

**Why These Choices?**

- **L2 regularization:** Prevents overfitting on correlated features
- **SAGA solver:** Faster convergence for large datasets, supports all penalty types
- **Class balancing:** Handles imbalanced data (more non-strugglers than strugglers)
- **Calibration:** Makes probabilities reliable (e.g., 70% prediction → actually struggle 70% of time)

#### Model Evaluation Metrics

Comprehensive evaluation following ML best practices:

```python
ModelMetrics {
    accuracy: float       # Overall correctness
    precision: float      # True positives / (True positives + False positives)
    recall: float         # True positives / (True positives + False negatives)
    f1_score: float       # Harmonic mean of precision and recall
    auc_roc: float        # Area under ROC curve
    confusion_matrix: [[TN, FP], [FN, TP]]
    classification_report: str  # Detailed per-class metrics
    calibration_curve: {prob_true, prob_pred}  # Reliability diagram
}
```

**Performance Targets (Story 5.2 requirements):**
- ✅ Accuracy: >75%
- ✅ Recall: >70% (prioritized - catch struggles)
- ✅ Precision: >65%
- ✅ Calibration: ±10% of actual rate

**Why Prioritize Recall?**

Cost asymmetry:
- **False Negative (missed struggle):** Student fails board exam 💀
- **False Positive (false alarm):** Low-cost proactive support 📚

Medical education stakes justify prioritizing recall over precision.

#### Feature Importance Calculation

**Two methods:**

1. **Correlation-based (rule-based model):**
   ```python
   importance = abs(pearson_correlation(feature, struggle_outcome))
   ```

2. **Coefficient-based (ML model):**
   ```python
   importance = abs(logistic_regression.coef_)
   normalized_importance = importance / sum(importance)
   ```

**Output:** Dictionary mapping feature names → importance scores (0-1, sum to 1.0)

#### Incremental Learning

**Weekly retraining pipeline:**
```python
model.update_model(new_feedback_data, warm_start=True)
```

Supports continuous improvement as user feedback accumulates.

#### Model Persistence

```python
# Save trained model
model.save("models/struggle_prediction_v1.pkl")

# Load for inference
model = StrugglePredictionModel.load("models/struggle_prediction_v1.pkl")
```

Enables model versioning and reproducibility.

## Usage Examples

### Example 1: Rule-Based Prediction (MVP)

```python
from ml import StruggleFeatureExtractor, StrugglePredictionModel

# Initialize
extractor = StruggleFeatureExtractor(db_client)
model = StrugglePredictionModel()

# Extract features
features = await extractor.extract_features_for_objective(
    user_id="user_123",
    objective_id="obj_456"
)

# Predict
prediction = model.predict(features)
print(f"Probability: {prediction.probability:.1%}")  # 75%
print(f"Risk: {prediction.risk_level}")              # HIGH
print(f"Reasoning: {prediction.reasoning}")          # "HIGH risk primarily due to low retention in this topic area."
```

### Example 2: Training ML Model (Post-MVP)

```python
from ml import StrugglePredictionModel, TrainingExample

# Prepare training data
training_data = []
for user_id, obj_id, struggled in historical_data:
    features = await extractor.extract_features_for_objective(user_id, obj_id)
    training_data.append(TrainingExample(
        features=features,
        struggled=struggled,
        user_id=user_id,
        objective_id=obj_id,
        recorded_at=datetime.utcnow()
    ))

# Train model
model = StrugglePredictionModel(model_version="v1.0")
metrics = model.train(training_data, test_size=0.2, calibrate=True)

# Evaluate
print(f"Accuracy: {metrics.accuracy:.1%}")    # 78% ✅
print(f"Recall: {metrics.recall:.1%}")        # 72% ✅
print(f"Precision: {metrics.precision:.1%}")  # 68% ✅

# Save
model.save("models/struggle_v1.pkl")
```

### Example 3: Incremental Learning

```python
# Weekly model update
new_feedback = get_feedback_last_week()
updated_metrics = model.update_model(new_feedback)
print(f"Accuracy improved by {updated_metrics.accuracy - prev_accuracy:.1%}")
```

drift_metrics = model.evaluate(weekly_predictions, weekly_actuals)

if drift_metrics.accuracy < TARGET_ACCURACY:
    trigger_retraining_workflow()
```

### A/B Testing

```python
# Compare model versions
model_v1 = StrugglePredictionModel.load("models/v1.pkl")
model_v2 = StrugglePredictionModel.load("models/v2.pkl")

# Route 50% to each
if hash(user_id) % 2 == 0:
    prediction = model_v1.predict(features)
else:
    prediction = model_v2.predict(features)
```

### Error Handling

```python
try:
    features = await extractor.extract_features_for_objective(user_id, obj_id)
    prediction = model.predict(features)
except ValueError as e:
    logger.warning(f"Insufficient data for {user_id}/{obj_id}: {e}")
    prediction = create_default_prediction()  # Fallback
except Exception as e:
    logger.error(f"Unexpected error: {e}")
    raise
```
