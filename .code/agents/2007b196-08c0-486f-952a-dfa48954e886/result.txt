**Proposing YAML normalization**

I need to think about how to normalize YAML frontmatter according to the guidelines. A minimal Node script could use gray-matter for parsing but, I want to avoid adding dependencies. Since we have Node available, I wonder if using built-in libraries or possibly js-yaml is the way to go. 

Still, bash with yq could be a solution, though it isn't guaranteed to be installed. I should outline two options: one with bash using `awk`/`sed` for inserting templates, and another as a Node script using local inline dependencies for YAML.
**Planning YAML normalization**

I’m considering a Node solution that avoids external dependencies by using lightweight regex to check for frontmatter presence and normalize known fields. It feels safer to suggest installing `yaml` and `glob` as devDependencies. Although the protocol emphasizes verifying packages, these are common in Node development. Since I’m only planning, I can outline command steps. I'll propose using either `yaml` with `fast-glob` or built-in `fs/promises`. I’ll also suggest a bash-only fallback and present the necessary commands for both options.
**Linking health and CI updates**

I want to connect the health strategy with CI updates. I’ll use markdown-link-check and implement directory rename globs. I’ll update the GitHub Actions configuration to check links only in changed files for faster runs and also set up a weekly job. For the migration strategy, I’ll cut a docs-consolidation branch, build a map, and rename files, running a link fix tool afterward. 

For internal links, I could add alias headers in frontmatter, but since 11ty isn’t in use, I might settle on creating stub files at old paths with links to new locations to help with redirects.
**Creating a migration script**

I’m thinking about generating `.md` files with frontmatter set to `deprecated: true` that point to new locations, but this might contradict my goal of reducing files. An alternative is to maintain `docs/.redirects.map` and depend on link checking for updates. It seems better to automate link updates since external inbound links aren't a concern within the repo. 

For the rollback plan, I’ll keep a `migration-log.json` for mapping moves and utilize `git mv` for tracking changes. I’ll also outline acceptance criteria and create a checklist, ensuring clarity. Adding shell commands with specific globs will be useful too!
**Drafting the Docs Pruning Plan**

I’m planning to archive `docs/**/notes/*.md` and unify duplicate topics from `docs/frontend-nextjs-*.md` into a single `docs/frontend` file. We won't fetch additional documentation since they use Next.js 15 and React 19. I'm also considering relevant globs for categorizing documents as "deprecated," "legacy," or "notes."

For link updates, I suggest a Node script to rewrite relative links and to configure markdown-link-check to ignore certain paths. 

I’ll structure the plan into phases, from inventory to acceptance criteria, and include migration examples. The goal is to achieve a 40-60% reduction in doc count while maintaining temporary stubs for old paths during transitions. Lastly, I’ll address frontmatter normalization and suggest strategies for deduplication with simple heuristics.

**Docs Pruning and Consolidation Plan**

- Goal: Reduce docs count by 40–60% while preserving essential knowledge and improving findability.
- Scope: Only a plan. No file edits in this run.

**Phases**

1) Inventory & Map
- List all docs and sizes: `git ls-files 'docs/**/*.md' | wc -l` and `git ls-files 'docs/**/*.md' > tmp/docs-all.txt`.
- Classify into keep, merge, move, archive using rules below; produce `tmp/docs-mapping.json` (from → to).
- Identify dupes by title/first H1: `rg -n '^# ' docs | awk -F: '{print $3}' | sort | uniq -c | sort -nr`.

2) Final IA & Target Layout
- Keep 6 top-level sections for navigation; quarantine deprecated content outside the IA.
- Target layout:
  - `docs/index.md` (Master index; update to reflect IA)
  - `docs/setup/` (onboarding, local env, tooling, “how to run”)
  - `docs/architecture/` (system overview, diagrams, cross-cutting concerns)
  - `docs/frontend/` (Next.js 15, React 19, Tailwind 4, shadcn/Radix, data fetching, state)
  - `docs/backend/` (FastAPI, routers, validation, typegen, services)
  - `docs/data/` (Prisma models, indexes, pgvector, migrations)
  - `docs/operations/` (CI/CD, observability, runbooks, release, SRE)
  - `docs/adr/` (all ADRs; keep `ADR-INDEX.md` here)
  - Not in IA (quarantine, excluded from nav and link checks by default):
    - `docs/deprecated/` (timeboxed archive)
    - `docs/_stubs/` (temporary one-liners used only during migration window)
- Section owners (lightweight): add `owner` field in frontmatter to each section’s README for long-term stewardship.

3) Deletion/Archival Rules (Globs, Rationale, Examples)
- Archival globs (move → `docs/deprecated/`):
  - `docs/**/deprecated/**` — already-marked deprecated; quarantine.
  - `docs/**/*{old,legacy,archive,archived,v1,v0,draft,temp,WIP}*.md` — historical or unstable notes.
  - `docs/**/notes/**` and `docs/**/scratch/**` — personal or exploratory notes.
  - `docs/**/images/**` that are unreferenced (found via link check report) — archive folder under `docs/deprecated/assets/`.
  - `docs/**/README.md` where the only content mirrors section README (duplicate intros detected by 90% similarity) — keep one canonical.
- Deletions (hard delete; keep list in `tmp/docs-deleted.txt`):
  - Files < 200 chars with no links and no unique info (empty placeholders).
  - Auto-generated outputs that can be re-generated (e.g., exported API docs snapshots if not current).
- Migrations (from → to), 5–10 concrete examples:
  - `docs/api-contracts.md` → `docs/backend/api-contracts.md` (update index and all internal links).
  - `docs/data-models.md` → `docs/data/data-models.md`.
  - `docs/architecture/ADR-INDEX.md` (stay) + move any stray ADRs like `docs/decisions/ADR-00X-*.md` → `docs/adr/ADR-00X-*.md`.
  - `docs/frontend-nextjs.md` or `docs/nextjs-app-router.md` → `docs/frontend/app-router.md`.
  - `docs/tailwind.md` → `docs/frontend/tailwind-4.md` (consolidate Tailwind v4 rules).
  - `docs/fastapi-overview.md` and `docs/backend-fastapi.md` → merge into `docs/backend/fastapi.md` (one canonical).
  - `docs/typegen.md` → `docs/backend/type-generation.md` (covers `apps/api/scripts/generate_types.py` → `apps/web/src/types/api-generated.ts` flow).
  - `docs/ml/fastapi.md` → `docs/backend/services-ml.md` or `docs/backend/services/ml-service.md` (align with services/ml-service).
  - `docs/shadcn-components.md` and `docs/radix-notes.md` → `docs/frontend/ui-components.md` (with shadcn/Radix sections).
  - `docs/ci.md` and `docs/github-actions.md` → `docs/operations/ci-cd.md`.
- Rationale highlights:
  - Eliminate duplicates by topic; keep one canonical per topic in the IA.
  - Quarantine low-signal and historical material for 60 days in `docs/deprecated/` before final purge.
  - Short placeholders create noise; remove unless linked by ADR.

4) Frontmatter Normalization (per docs/frontmatter-standard.md)
- Canonical fields to enforce (example; align to your standard names): 
  - `title, description, status (Draft|Active|Deprecated), updated_at (ISO 8601 with TZ), owner, tags (array), depends_on (array of paths), affects (array), related_adrs (array)`
- Minimal automation (Node; no heavy deps):
  - Dry-run audit:
    - `node -e "const fs=require('fs');const p=require('path');const F=s=>fs.readFileSync(s,'utf8');const g=(d)=>fs.readdirSync(d,{withFileTypes:true}).flatMap(x=>x.isDirectory()?g(p.join(d,x.name)):(x.name.endsWith('.md')?[p.join(d,x.name)]:[]));const files=g('docs');let missing=0;for(const f of files){const t=F(f);if(!/^---\\n[\\s\\S]*?\\n---/m.test(t)) {missing++; console.log('NOFM:',f);} }console.log('Missing frontmatter:',missing)"`
  - Bootstrap missing frontmatter (adds minimal template; preserves content):
    - `node scripts/frontmatter-normalize.mjs --write`
    - Example `scripts/frontmatter-normalize.mjs` behavior:
      - If no frontmatter: insert:
        ```
        ---
        title: "<derive from H1 or filename>"
        description: ""
        status: "Active"
        updated_at: "<auto: current ISO8601>"
        owner: "docs"
        tags: []
        depends_on: []
        affects: []
        related_adrs: []
        ---
        ```
      - If present: normalize keys, ensure `updated_at` is refreshed only when content changes (hash compare).
- Bash fallback (quick add for files without frontmatter):
  - `while read -r f; do h=$(basename "$f" .md | sed 's/-/ /g'); ts=$(date -u +"%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ"); awk -v T="$h" -v TS="$ts" 'BEGIN{print "---\ntitle: \""T"\"\ndescription: \"\"\nstatus: \"Active\"\nupdated_at: \""TS"\"\nowner: \"docs\"\ntags: []\ndepends_on: []\naffects: []\nrelated_adrs: []\n---"} {print} ' "$f" > "$f.tmp" && mv "$f.tmp" "$f"; done < <(rg -l --glob "docs/**/*.md" -n --invert-match "^---$" -z | tr -d '\\0')`
  - Note: Prefer Node script for idempotence and key normalization.

5) Link Health Strategy & CI Updates
- Strategy:
  - Generate `tmp/path-map.json` after moves (from → to). Use it to rewrite internal links in batch.
  - Exclude `docs/deprecated/**` and `docs/_stubs/**` from link checks to avoid false positives during the window.
  - Treat `docs/index.md` and all section READMEs as “golden files” — build must fail if they contain broken links.
- Rewrite internal links (Node one-liner using the map):
  - `node scripts/rewrite-links.mjs tmp/path-map.json --write`
  - Behavior: updates relative links and image refs; logs untouched files.
- CI (augment existing markdownlint + markdown-link-check):
  - Per-PR, changed-files only for speed:
    ```
    - name: Link Check (changed only)
      run: |
        CHANGED=$(git diff --name-only origin/main...HEAD -- 'docs/**/*.md' | xargs)
        if [ -n "$CHANGED" ]; then npx markdown-link-check -q $CHANGED; fi
    ```
  - Nightly full sweep:
    ```
    - cron: "23 3 * * *"
    - name: Link Check (full)
      run: rg -l '\.md$' docs | xargs -n 20 -I{} npx markdown-link-check -q {}
    ```
  - markdownlint config: add ignore for `docs/deprecated/**` and `docs/_stubs/**`.
  - Optional: generate a report artifact `tmp/link-report.json` and post summary.

6) Migration Strategy & Rollback
- Branching and logs:
  - Work on `docs/consolidation-YYYYMMDD`.
  - Record every `git mv` into `tmp/path-map.json` (machine- and human-readable).
  - Keep `tmp/migration-log.md` with rationale per group (dup, merge, archive).
- Execution order (minimize breakage):
  1. Normalize frontmatter (no path changes).
  2. Move/merge files per IA; write `tmp/path-map.json` as the source of truth.
  3. Rewrite internal links using the map.
  4. Update `docs/index.md` and each section `README.md`.
  5. Run lint + link checks; fix remaining.
  6. Generate short-lived stubs for external consumers only if necessary:
     - Create `docs/_stubs/<old-path>.md` with:
       ```
       ---
       title: "Moved: <old>"
       status: "Deprecated"
       updated_at: "<ISO8601>"
       ---
       This page moved to [`<new-path>`](../<new-path>).
       ```
     - Replace any on-disk old files only if external links cannot be updated. Remove stubs within 30 days.
- Rollback:
  - Full: `jq -r 'to_entries[] | "git mv \"" + .value + "\" \"" + .key + "\""' tmp/path-map.json | sh`
  - Partial: only specific subtree (e.g., `docs/frontend/**`) by filtering the map keys.
  - Always re-run link rewrite with the inverse map.
  - `git restore -SW -s ORIG_HEAD -- docs/` as last resort if merge-window is small.

7) Acceptance Criteria & Verification Checklist
- Acceptance Criteria
  - 40–60% reduction in `docs/**/*.md` count compared to baseline (`tmp/docs-all.txt`).
  - All files pass frontmatter normalization; zero “NOFM” findings.
  - `docs/index.md` links cleanly to exactly 6 IA sections and no others.
  - `markdownlint` and `markdown-link-check` succeed (PR and nightly).
  - Duplicated topics removed; one canonical page per topic in IA.
  - `docs/deprecated/` contains only quarantined material with a timestamp; size trend downward across two sprints.
- Verification Checklist
  - Run inventory again: `git ls-files 'docs/**/*.md' | wc -l` and confirm reduction target.
  - `node scripts/frontmatter-normalize.mjs` with `--check` returns 0 changes.
  - `npx markdownlint "docs/**/*.md"` passes (with ignores set).
  - `npx markdown-link-check -q $(rg -l '\.md$' docs | tr '\n' ' ')` passes (excluding quarantine).
  - Manually spot-check 10 high-traffic pages (index + each section README + 4 key topics).
  - Confirm `tmp/path-map.json` committed and reflects all moves.
  - Confirm `docs/adr/ADR-INDEX.md` resolves all ADR links.
  - Remove any temporary `docs/_stubs/**` older than 30 days.

**Deletion/Archival Globs (Copy-Paste List)**
- Archive:
  - `docs/**/deprecated/**`
  - `docs/**/*{old,legacy,archive,archived,v1,v0,draft,temp,WIP}*.md`
  - `docs/**/{notes,scratch,misc}/**/*.md`
  - `docs/**/images/**` (unreferenced only)
- Delete:
  - `docs/**/*.md` with size < 200 chars and no outbound links
  - Generated snapshots (if any): `docs/**/generated/**`

**Commands (Summary)**
- Inventory: `git ls-files 'docs/**/*.md' > tmp/docs-all.txt`
- Frontmatter audit: Node one-liner above
- Normalize (Node script): `node scripts/frontmatter-normalize.mjs --write`
- Moves: `jq -r 'to_entries[] | "git mv \"" + .key + "\" \"" + .value + "\""' tmp/path-map.json | sh`
- Rewrite links: `node scripts/rewrite-links.mjs tmp/path-map.json --write`
- Lint: `npx markdownlint "docs/**/*.md"`
- Link check (full): `rg -l '\.md$' docs | xargs -n 20 -I{} npx markdown-link-check -q {}`

**Risk Controls**
- All changes via `git mv` to preserve history.
- `tmp/path-map.json` is the reversible contract; keep it updated.
- Quarantine window (60 days) before permanent deletion.
- Stubs only for externally referenced hot paths; audited and timeboxed.

This plan delivers a lean, six-section IA, a reversible migration, strict frontmatter normalization, reliable link health in CI, and a clear acceptance gate to hit a 40–60% reduction without losing essential knowledge.
