**Clarifying printing logic**

I realized that default printing happens at the end of the cycle. The 'n' command prints the pattern space and then reads the next line into the pattern space. When skipping lines inside a code block, I want to print those lines unchanged as 'n' flows through. The substitution block applies only to lines outside the code blocks. For a robust approach, I'll implement a method that ensures the mapping-driven rewrite rule uses the correct pairs from my mapping file.
**Detailing markdown processing**

I need to address the instructions carefully and mention code spans only if necessary. The user wants to skip fenced code blocks and avoid auto links implicitly. For producing idempotent `sed` rules, that means ensuring repeated runs won’t change anything or introduce errors. 

For rule (b), I’ll replace markdown links starting with `]( /apps/web/... )` to `]( ../apps/web/... )`. I’ll ensure that already relative links don't get changed again and confirm that the skip block wrapper properly handles any fenced code blocks. This way, I’ll maintain idempotency effectively.
**Clarifying image matching logic**

I need to make sure we’re not matching images that have a preceding '!'. To do this, I can use negative lookbehind `(?<!\!)`, although `sed -E` doesn’t support lookbehind in basic ERE. Instead, I can target the closing bracket ']' that is preceded by something. The challenge is distinguishing whether ']' belongs to a link or an image. Since images have a '!' before '[', I need to ensure that the character before '[' isn’t '!'. It's tricky because the character before ']' can vary.
**Exploring link rewriting in sed**

I want to apply a negative lookbehind to avoid matching images, like using `(?<!...)`. Unfortunately, `sed -E` doesn’t support PCRE lookbehind, which complicates things. One alternative is to require that the character before '[' isn’t a '!'. I can work with a pattern that captures both the link text and the path, like `(^|[^!])\[[^]]*\]\(/apps/web/([^)]*)\)`. 

The replacement would reconstruct the full matched link by capturing necessary groups. I need to make sure the regex handles potential issues with nested brackets effectively. It’s all a bit complicated but doable!
**Creating a rewrite plan for links**

I need to avoid altering code inside fenced blocks while converting absolute repository-root links to relative ones for `/apps/web/`. This means we can safely include images in the conversion, given that the user isn’t concerned about excluding them. 

I plan to implement a `sed` command that skips over fenced code blocks, ensuring that it doesn’t affect any code within those. The command will have a structure that efficiently processes links while maintaining the necessary logic for skipping and conditional processing. I’ll also include a mapping-driven rewrite rule based on the user’s specifications. It's a bit complex, but it’s manageable!
**Formulating sed commands**

I need to ensure that I avoid auto-links and focus on converting links using a mapping file. This requires creating dynamic `sed` rules that correctly match and replace patterns like `](FROM` to `](TO`. I must escape special characters appropriately, particularly when using delimiters in `sed`. 

Given the complexity, I can offer a robust approach with an `awk` script to handle character escaping and generate the appropriate `sed` command. I also want to ensure that the final commands skip fenced code blocks, perform necessary conversions, and adhere to mapping-driven rules. It’s going to be quite comprehensive!
**Creating sed one-liners**

I’m working on producing a one-liner for converting absolute paths in Markdown links from `/apps/web/` to `../apps/web/`, while skipping fenced code blocks. It’s important that I ensure the command is idempotent.

I want to create a robust `awk`-to-`sed` command that rewrites only inside parentheses, preserves link formatting, and accounts for special characters. I’ll also need to incorporate logic to handle mapping pairs from a file and ensure the command works in one line while maintaining clarity and proper usage. It’s a lot to keep together!
**Crafting sed one-liners**

I'm focusing on creating BSD sed one-liners that help convert absolute paths in Markdown links from `/apps/web/` to `../apps/web/` while ensuring they skip fenced code blocks and avoid autolinks. The goal is for these commands to be idempotent and run across multiple files.

I’ll also incorporate an `awk` mapping-driven rewrite rule to handle specified FROM|TO pairs, ensuring adjustments follow the right sequence. Lastly, I'll provide a concise validation checklist so users can easily check their work. It's all about keeping it neat and effective!

Here are paste-ready BSD sed -E one‑liners that are idempotent, skip fenced code blocks, and avoid autolinks.

**Apps/Web Absolute → Relative**
- Single file: converts ](/apps/web/...) → ](../apps/web/...) outside ``` fences
  - `sed -E -i '' '/^[[:space:]]*```/{:F; n; /^[[:space:]]*```/!bF; b}; s@]\(/apps/web/@](../apps/web/@g' path/to/file.md`
- Many files (example): find candidates then rewrite
  - `rg -l '\]\(/apps/web/' -- '*.md' | xargs -I{} sed -E -i '' '/^[[:space:]]*```/{:F; n; /^[[:space:]]*```/!bF; b}; s@]\(/apps/web/@](../apps/web/@g' {}`

Notes:
- Skips fenced code blocks started/ended by lines beginning with triple backticks; autolinks like `<https://…>` are untouched because only `[...](...)` is targeted.
- Idempotent: already‑relative links `](../apps/web/...)` do not match, so a second run is a no‑op.

**Mapping‑Driven Rewrites (FROM|TO pairs)**
- With process substitution (zsh/bash): generate a sed script from `docs/_migration/.move-list-active.tmp` and apply it, still skipping fenced blocks.
  - `sed -E -i '' '/^[[:space:]]*```/{:F; n; /^[[:space:]]*```/!bF; b};' -f <(awk -F'\\|' 'NF==2{from=$1;to=$2; gsub(/[][(){}.^$*+?|\\]/,"\\\\&",from); gsub(/[@&\\]/,"\\\\&",to); printf "s@]\\(%s\\)@](%s)@g\n",from,to}' docs/_migration/.move-list-active.tmp) path/to/file.md`
- Portable fallback (no process substitution): pipe the generated sed script on stdin.
  - `awk -F'\\|' 'NF==2{from=$1;to=$2; gsub(/[][(){}.^$*+?|\\]/,"\\\\&",from); gsub(/[@&\\]/,"\\\\&",to); printf "s@]\\(%s\\)@](%s)@g\n",from,to}' docs/_migration/.move-list-active.tmp | sed -E -i '' '/^[[:space:]]*```/{:F; n; /^[[:space:]]*```/!bF; b};' -f - path/to/file.md`

Notes:
- Only `[...](FROM)` → `[...](TO)` is rewritten; images `![...](...)` are also covered if present in the pairs. Autolinks `<…>` are never matched.
- Escaping in awk makes FROM literal in the regex and TO safe in the replacement, keeping the run idempotent.

**Validation Checklist**
- Dry run first (no `-i`): add `-n -e 'p'` to preview, or run `rg '\]\(/apps/web/' --count` before/after.
- Confirm code blocks untouched: spot check files with ``` fences.
- Verify no autolinks changed: `rg -n '<https?://|<\/[^>]*>'` should show no diffs from the run.
- Existence filter: before applying (b), feed only links whose targets exist (your separate check).
- Re-run commands: confirm zero further changes on a second run (idempotence).
