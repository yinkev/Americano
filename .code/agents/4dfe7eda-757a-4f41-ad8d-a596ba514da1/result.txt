Produce BSD sed -E one-liners that: (a) skip fenced code blocks (``` … ```), (b) convert absolute repo-root links to relative for apps/web only, and (c) template a mapping-driven rewrite rule for internal docs. Include a short validation checklist.

Context: Need precise, idempotent BSD sed rules to rewrite links safely. Avoid fenced code blocks and autolinks. Convert ](/apps/web/...) to ](../apps/web/...) only when the target exists (we will run existence checks separately). Provide a template for mapping-based rewrites using FROM|TO pairs from docs/_migration/.move-list-active.tmp. macOS/BSD sed. Keep commands concise and ready to paste.

Desired output: BSD sed one-liners + brief validation checklist

**Providing BSD sed one-liners with code block skipping**
**Supplying sed commands with escaping and validation tips**

I’m laying out BSD sed one-liners to skip fenced code blocks while rewriting links, including a mapping-driven approach with proper escaping for safe use. I’ll also add a short checklist to help verify everything works smoothly.

**BSD Sed One-Liners**
```sh
# (a) Template rewrite that skips fenced code blocks (replace FROM_PATTERN / TO_REPLACEMENT as needed)
sed -E '/^```/,/^```/{b}; s#FROM_PATTERN#TO_REPLACEMENT#g' TARGET.md

# (b) Idempotent apps/web repo-root → relative link rewrite (use -i '' for in-place edits on macOS/BSD sed)
sed -E '/^```/,/^```/{b}; s#\]\(/(apps/web/[^)]*)\)#](../\1)#g' -i '' TARGET.md

# (c) Mapping-driven internal-doc rewrite using docs/_migration/.move-list-active.tmp (FROM|TO pairs)
while IFS='|' read -r from to; do from_esc=$(printf '%s\n' "$from" | sed -E 's/[][\\.^$*+?(){}|#-]/\\&/g'); to_esc=$(printf '%s\n' "$to" | sed -E 's/[&#]/\\&/g'); sed -E "/^```/,/^```/{b}; s#\]\($from_esc\)#]($to_esc)#g" -i '' TARGET.md; done < docs/_migration/.move-list-active.tmp
```

**Validation Checklist**
- Confirm each target file with `rg '\]\(/apps/web/'` before/after; expect only desired links to change.
- Spot-check representative Markdown files to ensure fenced code blocks (` ``` `) remain untouched.
- Re-run each sed command to verify idempotence (no diff on the second pass).
- Execute your planned existence checks before accepting the `../apps/web/...` rewrites.
- Finish with `git status` / `git diff` to review the precise edits.
