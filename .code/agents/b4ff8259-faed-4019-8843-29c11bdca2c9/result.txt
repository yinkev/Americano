Context: Americano monorepo; docs IA migration in October 2025; fix docs errors.

Agent: You are one of several planning agents. Produce a concrete, step-by-step plan to “fix the error” in this repo. Error context: documentation IA migration partially applied; markdown lint and link checks are failing. Goal: propose the best approach to resolve all docs errors safely and predictably, with minimal churn, and ensure CI passes. Provide rationale and alternatives where useful. Include verification steps. Keep plan actionable for a single engineer to execute in ~2–4 hours.

Repository summary (monorepo):
- Root `package.json` scripts:
  - `lint:docs`: runs `markdownlint` on `docs/**/*.md` and root/bmad. Current run fails with multiple MD024/MD025, MD052 and one MD018.
  - `check:links`: runs `markdown-link-check` against all docs; currently shows many dead links.
- Frontend: `apps/web` (Next.js 15 + React 19) with Prisma 6.
- ML service: `services/ml-service` (FastAPI). Not directly relevant to current docs errors.

Current branch: docs/moves-2025-10 (modified: `docs/index.md`).

Reproduction (just ran locally):
- `npm run lint:docs` → non-zero exit with examples:
  - MD025 single H1 violations in: `docs/stories/story-2.6.md` etc.
  - MD024 duplicate headings in several files (siblings_only=true in config).
  - MD018 missing space after `###` in `docs/stories/story-5.5.md` line ~927.
  - MD052 reference links use undefined labels in `docs/stories/story-2.4.md`.
- `npm run check:links` → non-zero; representative failures:
  - Many 400s to internal files that are being moved, e.g. `docs/database/migrations.md` references `../apps/web/prisma/schema.prisma`, `./EPIC5-DEPLOYMENT-GUIDE.md`, `./development-environment-setup.md`, and `../apps/web/docs/api/openapi.yaml`.
  - External: `https://flowlabs.google/` (Status 0).
  - Absolute repo paths like `/apps/web/components/...` (should be relative `../apps/web/...` or fenced code blocks instead of links).

Migration scaffolding present:
- `docs/_migration/move-commands.sh` (dry-run git mv generator)
- `docs/_migration/link-rewrites.proposed.sh` (sed-based rewriter). It consumes mapping from:
- `docs/_migration/.move-list-active.tmp` (FROM|TO pairs). Examples:
  - `docs/api/api-contracts.md|docs/backend/api-contracts.md`
  - `docs/database/migrations.md|docs/operations/migrations.md`
  - `docs/design/animation-quick-start.md|docs/frontend/design-system.md`

Lint configs:
- `.markdownlint.json` → Many rules disabled; MD024 set `siblings_only: true`, MD025 `front_matter_title: ""`.
- `.markdown-link-check.json` → ignores localhost, in-fragment GitHub, and `docs/deprecated/`; timeout 5s; retries enabled.

Constraints & objectives:
- Avoid mass churn outside of moved/impacted files.
- Preserve `git` history where possible (`git mv`).
- After changes, `npm run lint:docs` and `npm run check:links` must pass locally.
- Provide a rollback plan.

Deliverables for your plan:
1) A phased plan with concrete commands to run (bash), ordered by safety (dry runs → commits), including how to preview changes.
2) Guidance on updating link targets vs. adding redirect stubs vs. adjusting the checker config.
3) A small set of targeted content fixes for MD024/MD025/MD052/MD018 (patterns + examples) without excessive rewriting.
4) A verification matrix and exit criteria.
5) Risks and mitigations.

Key files for reference:
- `.markdownlint.json` (root)
- `.markdown-link-check.json` (root)
- `docs/_migration/move-commands.sh`
- `docs/_migration/link-rewrites.proposed.sh`
- `docs/_migration/.move-list-active.tmp`
- Example failing files mentioned above.

Assume a macOS dev shell with `git`, `sed` (BSD), Node 20+, and no extra tools. Avoid heavy, custom scripts unless truly needed. Prefer surgical changes and idempotent scripts.

Desired output: A concrete, stepwise plan + rationale + verification checklist + risk notes

**Drafting detailed docs fix plan**

I'm putting together a thorough plan to fix the documentation issues step-by-step. It will cover preparation, reviewing migration mappings, applying moves with dry runs, fixing markdown lint rules like MD025 and MD024, rewriting links carefully with minimal churn, verifying with git and lint commands, plus a rollback and risk mitigation strategy. This plan will also include rationale and alternatives to keep updates safe and clean.
[2025-10-30T01:55:49] codex

**Docs Fix Plan**  
- **Phase 0 – Prep & Baseline**  
  - `npm ci` (fresh deps) and `npm run lint:docs` + `npm run check:links` to capture current failures.  
  - `git status` and review `git diff --stat` to confirm only docs touched.  
  - Rationale: establish reproducible baseline and confirm no hidden file drift.

- **Phase 1 – Map Review & Dry Runs**  
  - Inspect `docs/_migration/.move-list-active.tmp` for accuracy; remove stale entries and add missing source→target pairs for files showing link 404s (e.g. `docs/database/migrations.md`).  
  - `bash docs/_migration/move-commands.sh --dry-run` (script already supports dry run) then `bash docs/_migration/link-rewrites.proposed.sh --dry-run`.  
  - Rationale: validate planned file moves and link rewrites without touching working tree.

- **Phase 2 – Apply Moves Safely**  
  - When satisfied, run `bash docs/_migration/move-commands.sh` (actual `git mv`).  
  - Immediately add new redirect stubs where we intentionally keep legacy paths (e.g. create short pointer file that links to the new location) if consumer tooling still references the old path.  
  - Preview with `git status` and `git diff` to ensure only expected renames occurred.  
  - Alternative: manual `git mv` for any outliers not covered by the script to keep history.

- **Phase 3 – Fix Markdownlint Offenders**  
  - Targeted edits only:  
    - `docs/stories/story-2.6.md`, `story-2.4.md`, etc.: keep a single `#` heading; demote subsequent H1s to H2/H3 or convert to intro paragraphs.  
    - Resolve MD024 duplicates by appending context qualifiers (e.g. “### Deployment Steps (v2)”) or merging sections; avoid structural churn.  
    - `docs/stories/story-5.5.md`: add missing space after `###`.  
    - Reference links in `docs/stories/story-2.4.md`: define `[label]: URL` blocks near file end or convert to inline links; remove unused definitions to silence MD052.  
  - Use `npm run lint:docs -- --fix` only if config allows; otherwise manual edits to keep change scope tight.  
  - Rationale: address lint complaints directly instead of weakening rules.

- **Phase 4 – Update Broken Links**  
  - For links pointing to moved internal files, run `bash docs/_migration/link-rewrites.proposed.sh` (non-dry) after confirming mapping; inspect patch for each change.  
  - Convert absolute repo-root links (`/apps/web/...`) to relative (`../apps/web/...`) or wrap in code block if referencing a path rather than a document.  
  - For internal docs that are temporarily missing, add redirect stub markdown pages containing front matter + “Moved to …” link until destination exists; ensures link-check success without content loss.  
  - External dead links: replace with active equivalents (e.g. update Flow Labs URL to current domain) or annotate with `[link text](URL "linkcheck-ignore")` if authoritative but temporarily offline (use sparingly).  
  - If a link should remain but points to private/internal resource, add it to `.markdown-link-check.json` `ignorePatterns` with justification; prefer fixing content first.

- **Phase 5 – Regression Pass & Content Polish**  
  - Spot-check moved files for broken relative image refs or local anchors.  
  - Ensure front-matter and table-of-contents blocks still align after heading demotions.

- **Phase 6 – Verification & Snapshot**  
  - `npm run lint:docs`  
  - `npm run check:links`  
  - `git status` (no unexpected files)  
  - `git diff` (review for accidental mass edits)  
  - Optionally `npm test` or relevant doc site preview if rendering changes are large.

- **Phase 7 – Commit & Rollback Plan**  
  - Stage logical chunks (`git add docs/...`).  
  - Commit message suggestion: `fix: migrate docs IA links and lint issues`.  
  - Rollback: if plan derails, `git restore --staged` + `git restore` on touched files, or `git reset --hard HEAD` before commit; for post-commit rollback use `git reset --hard HEAD^`.

**Link Update Guidance**  
- Update target paths when the destination doc exists or is moved in this patch; rely on mapping + rewrite script for consistency.  
- Add redirect stub when: external consumers still reference old path, or destination lives in another repo pending migration. Keep stub short (front matter + link).  
- Adjust `.markdown-link-check.json` only when a link is intentionally non-resolvable (e.g. internal VPN resource) and document justification in a comment above the new ignore entry.

**Lint Rule Fix Patterns**  
- MD025 (single H1): enforce single `#` per file; convert sub-sections to `##` or `###`; if multiple logical titles, merge using introductory paragraph.  
- MD024 (duplicate headings): append qualifiers or restructure lists (e.g. “### Rollout” → “### Rollout (Phase 1)”).  
- MD052 (undefined references): ensure every `[label]` usage has a matching `[label]: URL` definition; remove orphan definitions.  
- MD018 (space after heading marker): search for `^###\S` and insert missing space.

**Verification Matrix & Exit Criteria**  
- `npm run lint:docs` → exits 0.  
- `npm run check:links` → exits 0, no `0` or `4xx` statuses.  
- `git status` → only intentional files staged/modified.  
- Manual spot-check → moved docs open in editor/browser with correct TOC and anchors.  
- Optional: if docs are rendered elsewhere, run local preview (e.g. `npm run dev` in docs site) to ensure navigation works.  
Exit when all checks pass and plan’s scope completed.

**Risks & Mitigations**  
- Scripted moves touching wrong files → mitigate via dry-run diff review before executing live.  
- BSD `sed` quirks in rewrite script → test on single file or run inside subshell, keep backup (unstaged changes) to revert quickly.  
- Link checker timeouts on flaky external sites → prefer fixing URL/adding retry before suppressing; if suppression necessary, document reason.  
- Heading demotions breaking inbound anchors → run search for `(#old-heading)` references and add anchor aliases (`<a id="old-heading"></a>`) where needed.  
- Large diff noise from automated rewrite → stage hunks interactively (`git add -p`) to isolate intentional edits.

This plan keeps changes surgical, relies on existing migration tooling, and leaves clear checkpoints for early rollback if something looks off.
