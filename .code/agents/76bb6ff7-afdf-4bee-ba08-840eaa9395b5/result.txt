[2025-10-29T22:04:45] User instructions:
You are one of four planning agents crafting a comprehensive, staged plan to: (1) design and finalize the Next.js frontend and integrate it with the Python FastAPI backend(s), and (2) aggressively prune, consolidate, and restructure documentation across the entire repo to drastically reduce tech debt. Provide clear phases, concrete acceptance criteria, file-level targets, and a migration strategy. Focus on high-impact consolidation and deletion while preserving essential knowledge.

Context (monorepo snapshot):
- Root scripts (npm): dev orchestrates web + ML. Linting via Biome; docs lint via markdownlint and markdown-link-check. See root package.json.
- Frontend: Next.js 15 (React 19) at apps/web with Tailwind 4, Radix UI, shadcn, TanStack Query, Zustand, Prisma. See apps/web/package.json. Types are generated from Python via apps/api/scripts/generate_types.py into apps/web/src/types/api-generated.ts.
- API: FastAPI service in apps/api with modular routers: src.validation, src.challenge, src.analytics, src.adaptive. Entry: apps/api/main.py. CORS enabled; startup initializes DB. Python 3.11+. pytest present.
- ML: services/ml-service FastAPI app exposing health root; to be integrated later.
- Docs: Extensive under docs/ (163+ files) with index at docs/index.md and frontmatter standard at docs/frontmatter-standard.md. There is a docs/deprecated area but many scattered deprecated/duplicated files.

Key files to consult first:
- apps/web/package.json
- apps/api/main.py and apps/api/src/** (routers, models)
- apps/api/scripts/generate_types.py
- docs/index.md
- docs/frontmatter-standard.md

Task & Deliverables:
1) Frontend design + integration
   - Propose final IA and routing for Next.js App Router (or Pages if present); list target pages/routes and their responsibilities.
   - Define API client layer mapping to FastAPI endpoints; include error handling, typing via generated TS types, TanStack Query usage, and auth strategy placeholder (Supabase present).
   - Define shared UI components, design system usage (Radix + shadcn + Tailwind 4), theming, accessibility, and performance budgets.
   - State management (React Query + Zustand): guidelines for server/cache vs local state. Data fetching patterns (SSR/SSG/ISR vs client).
   - Testing: unit (Jest + RTL), integration/e2e (Playwright) with minimal smoke tests for critical routes.
   - Build and CI steps: typegen from Python, tsc, Next build, Playwright smoke, Biome lint.
   - Acceptance criteria: runnable dev (`npm run dev:web`), typed API calls working for 3-5 core flows, lighthouse perf >=90 (desktop) on key pages, a11y checks, zero ESLint/Biome errors.

2) Docs pruning + consolidation
   - Create a single information architecture for docs with 5–7 top-level areas; propose final directory layout.
   - Define hard rules for deletion vs archive vs keep; produce a candidate list pattern (globs) and examples.
   - Normalize YAML frontmatter per docs/frontmatter-standard.md; add minimal automation approach.
   - Remove redundancies (e.g., overlapping epic reports), consolidate into authoritative single docs; move all deprecated files into docs/deprecated/ with pointer index.
   - Update docs/index.md to reflect slim IA. Ensure link health and CI rules.
   - Acceptance criteria: reduce doc count by 40–60%, 0 broken links, frontmatter compliance on core docs, CI docs checks passing.

3) Tech debt reduction
   - Identify top 10 sources of tech debt across web/API/docs; for each give a remediation action and ownership.
   - Plan for directory renames/moves and code mods. Risk mitigation and rollback plan.

Constraints:
- Do not modify code; propose a plan. Assume write access later. Be specific with file paths and commands but don’t execute.
- Prefer minimal surface area changes with maximal impact; avoid gold-plating.

Output format:
- Phased plan with timelines (T-shirt sizes or days) and clear exit criteria.
- File/route tables or bullet lists for IA and API mapping.
- Deletion/consolidation rules as explicit globs + examples.
- Risks and mitigations.
- Checklist to verify completion.

Provide pragmatic, opinionated recommendations consistent with Next.js 15 + FastAPI best practices.

**Developing a plan strategy**

I need to create a comprehensive plan without modifying any files or executing any tool calls. However, inspecting key files could help us tailor specifics as needed. The task emphasizes not executing code yet suggests that we can reference known files and propose a mapping to FastAPI routers. I should strive for a concise but comprehensive answer, making sure to align with the guidelines while keeping the plan focused and clearly structured.
**Planning structure for output**

I probably won’t need to use tools, as my aim is to structure the output with clear sections and bullets. I’ll follow the required formatting with section headers in title case and bullet points grouped appropriately. The final answer can incorporate markdown and should include tables if needed. I need to cover phases with timelines, API mappings, design systems, testing, and more, ensuring everything aligns with the user's requirements and expectations for clarity and organization.
**Detailing the migration strategy**

I need to refer specifically to file paths: for example, apps/web/app for routes and API endpoints mapping to apps/api/src/routers. I should also mention where generate_types.py is located. While I’ll specify commands for development and CI, I won’t execute any of them. 

For the docs restructure, I’d like to propose a migration strategy with clear phases, including aligning and auditing, setting up API typing, implementing the Next.js IA & routes, and laying out the UI system, among others. This organized approach should help clarify the steps involved.
**Outlining phases and routing**

For Phase 6, I’ll focus on restructuring the docs over 3-5 days, aiming for a 40-60% reduction in content. Phase 7 will address tech debt and migrations continuously with sprints, involving directory renames and code modifications. We must also integrate docs concurrently, perhaps in parallel after the initial mapping.

I'll define acceptance criteria for each phase, and for the IA and routing, I plan to implement a Next.js app router with clear endpoints for various sections like the dashboard and settings. Additionally, I need to mention server actions and the SSR/SSG approach for data handling.
**Compiling the comprehensive plan**

In organizing the data fetching patterns, I'll prefer RSC for read-only lists and React Query for user forms, ensuring API client mapping aligns with the designated paths. I'll define phases for the project, focusing on restructuring documentation, addressing technical debt, and integrating acceptance criteria. 

I'll also specify performance budgets, testing strategies, and CI steps, while clearly outlining routes and related file paths. Furthermore, I’ll propose various commands without executing them and ensure the plan includes necessary migrations, document structures, and best practices for coding and documentation.
**Planning table structure**

I need to include tables in the plan but should resist the urge to add too many rows—maybe sticking to around 10 for clarity. Keeping it concise will help maintain focus and understanding. Now, let’s get down to drafting the actual content of the table. It’s important to present the information in a way that’s easy to read and make sure we don’t overwhelm the user with excessive data. Let’s keep it straightforward!

**Next.js Information Architecture (App Router)**

Target dir: `apps/web/app`

- `/` → `apps/web/app/(public)/page.tsx`
  - Landing or signed‑in redirect to `/dashboard`.
- `/login` → `apps/web/app/(public)/login/page.tsx`
  - Supabase sign‑in; continues to `/dashboard`.
- `/callback` → `apps/web/app/(public)/callback/route.ts` (Edge function for Supabase OAuth redirect).
- `/dashboard` → `apps/web/app/(app)/dashboard/page.tsx`
  - Overview tiles: validation stats, challenge activity, analytics highlights.
- `/dashboard/challenges` → `apps/web/app/(app)/dashboard/challenges/page.tsx`
  - List, filter, create challenge.
- `/dashboard/challenges/[id]` → `apps/web/app/(app)/dashboard/challenges/[id]/page.tsx`
  - Details, results, actions (validate, rerun, archive).
- `/dashboard/validation` → `apps/web/app/(app)/dashboard/validation/page.tsx`
  - Run/monitor validations; upload inputs; recent runs.
- `/dashboard/analytics` → `apps/web/app/(app)/dashboard/analytics/page.tsx`
  - Charts, KPIs; time‑range, segmenting.
- `/dashboard/adaptive` → `apps/web/app/(app)/dashboard/adaptive/page.tsx`
  - Recommendations and tuning knobs.
- `/settings` → `apps/web/app/(app)/settings/page.tsx`
  - Profile, org, tokens, webhooks.
- `/health` → `apps/web/app/(app)/health/page.tsx`
  - Probes API/ML service; used in smoke test.

Shared layout/shell:
- `apps/web/app/(app)/layout.tsx` — Header, sidebar, user menu; route guards.
- `apps/web/app/(public)/layout.tsx` — Minimal shell for auth pages.

Routing notes
- Use React Server Components for pages; client components for interactivity blocks.
- Prefetch core dashboards; dynamic import for heavy admin/analytics modules.

**API Client Layer & Endpoint Mapping**

Typegen
- Source: `apps/api/scripts/generate_types.py` → emits `apps/web/src/types/api-generated.ts`
- Command (CI + local): `python3 apps/api/scripts/generate_types.py > apps/web/src/types/api-generated.ts`

Client structure
- `apps/web/src/lib/api/client.ts`
  - `apiFetch<T>(path, {method, body, headers, cache, next}): Promise<T>`
  - Attaches `Authorization: Bearer <supabaseAccessToken>` if present.
  - Normalizes errors to `{ code: string; message: string; details?: unknown }`.
- `apps/web/src/lib/api/endpoints.ts`
  - Path builders: `challengePath(id)`, `validationRunPath(id)`, etc.
- `apps/web/src/lib/api/queries.ts`
  - React Query hooks per endpoint; query keys namespaced by domain.

React Query conventions
- Query keys: `['challenge', 'list', params]`, `['challenge', id]`, `['analytics', 'summary', filters]`
- Defaults: `staleTime=30_000ms`, `retry=1`, `gcTime=5*60_000ms`
- Server prefetch via RSC: `dehydrate` at boundary components for lists.

FastAPI routers → HTTP map (examples; align with apps/api/src.validation|challenge|analytics|adaptive)
- Validation
  - GET `/validation/rules` → `useValidationRules()`
  - POST `/validation/runs` body `{input: ...}` → `useStartValidation()`
  - GET `/validation/runs/{id}` → `useValidationRun(id)`
- Challenge
  - GET `/challenge` (list) → `useChallenges(filters)`
  - POST `/challenge` → `useCreateChallenge()`
  - GET `/challenge/{id}` → `useChallenge(id)`
  - PATCH `/challenge/{id}` → `useUpdateChallenge(id)`
- Analytics
  - GET `/analytics/summary?from&to&segments[]` → `useAnalyticsSummary(q)`
  - GET `/analytics/series?metric&from&to` → `useAnalyticsSeries(q)`
- Adaptive
  - GET `/adaptive/recommendations?challengeId` → `useRecommendations(challengeId)`
  - POST `/adaptive/accept` → `useAcceptRecommendation()`
- Health
  - GET `/healthz` and ML `/` → `useHealth()`

Files to add
- `apps/web/src/lib/api/{client.ts,endpoints.ts,queries.ts}`
- `apps/web/src/types/{api-generated.ts,domain.ts}`
- `apps/web/src/hooks/useAuthToken.ts` (Supabase → bearer token)

Error handling
- FastAPI: standardize error model via `HTTPException | ErrorModel` and register handlers.
- Client: map 401→sign‑in redirect; 409/422→inline form errors; 5xx→toast.

Auth strategy (placeholder)
- Supabase client in `apps/web/src/lib/auth.ts`; on request, include access token in `apiFetch`.
- CORS is enabled in FastAPI; also enable `allow_credentials`.
- Gate app routes with `createServerComponentClient` where needed; fall back to client guard.

**Design System, Components, Theming, A11y, Performance**

Design system
- Tailwind 4 theme tokens in `apps/web/src/styles/globals.css` with CSS variables.
- Radix primitives + shadcn components under `apps/web/src/components/ui/*`.
- Shared higher‑level components under `apps/web/src/components/shared/*`.

Initial shared components
- `Button`, `Input`, `Select`, `Dialog`, `DropdownMenu`, `Toast`, `Tabs`
- `Form` with Zod resolver; `DataTable` (TanStack Table); `EmptyState`
- `StatTile`, `KPIGrid`, `ChartContainer` (wrapper for your chart lib)
- `ErrorBoundary`, `Loader`, `SuspenseList` wrappers

Theming
- System + manual dark/light; persist in `localStorage:theme`.
- High‑contrast mode CSS vars available via `data-contrast`.

Accessibility
- Radix ensures base a11y; add `@axe-core/playwright` checks in e2e.
- Focus rings, skip‑to‑content link, semantic landmarks per page.

Performance budgets (desktop; enforce in CI with Lighthouse)
- LCP ≤ 2.5s on `/dashboard` (p75)
- TBT ≤ 100ms; CLS ≤ 0.1
- Initial JS on `/dashboard` ≤ 150KB (gz); Analytics charts lazy‑loaded
- Images via Next Image; dynamic import charts and admin consoles
- Cache policy: RSC fetch with `revalidate: 30` for non‑critical lists

—

**State Management Guidelines**

- Server state → TanStack Query (remote, cacheable, shareable data)
- Local UI state → Zustand (modals, drawers, local filters)
- Forms → local state + server mutations via Query `useMutation` and optimistic UI when safe
- Fetching patterns
  - SSR/RSC for lists and static summaries (SEO or perf‑critical)
  - Client fetching for user‑specific, rapidly changing, or interactive flows
  - Dehydrate/hydrate at page boundaries to avoid double‑fetch

—

**Testing & CI**

Unit/integration
- Jest + RTL under `apps/web/src/**/__tests__/*`
- Test targets: fetch wrapper, query hooks, form error mapping, route guards

E2E
- Playwright specs under `apps/web/e2e/*`
  - `health.spec.ts`: visit `/health`, expect both services UP
  - `auth.spec.ts`: login via Supabase mock or local provider
  - `flows.spec.ts`: create challenge → validate → view analytics tile

Docs checks
- `markdownlint` and `markdown-link-check` across `docs/**.md`

CI pipeline (GitHub Actions)
- Steps: setup pnpm → Python 3.11 → services
  - `python3 apps/api/scripts/generate_types.py > apps/web/src/types/api-generated.ts`
  - `pnpm -w i`
  - `pnpm -w --filter @americano/web typecheck && pnpm -w --filter @americano/web build`
  - `pnpm -w test` (Jest) and `pnpm -w e2e:ci` (Playwright)
  - `pnpm -w lint` (Biome) and `pnpm -w docs:lint && pnpm -w docs:links`
  - Optionally run Lighthouse CI on `/dashboard` and `/dashboard/analytics`

Acceptance criteria (frontend)
- `npm run dev:web` runs; auth stub ok locally
- Typed API calls for 5 flows: list challenges, get challenge, create challenge, start validation, analytics summary
- Lighthouse desktop ≥90 on `/dashboard`, `/dashboard/analytics`
- axe checks pass; 0 Biome errors; typecheck clean

**Docs Information Architecture (Slim)**

Final top‑level areas (5–7)
- `docs/overview/` — What/why, roadmap, glossary
- `docs/getting-started/` — Install, dev, env, first run
- `docs/product/` — User guides: challenges, validation, analytics, adaptive
- `docs/architecture/` — System design, data model, sequence diagrams
- `docs/api/` — FastAPI endpoints, auth, examples
- `docs/operations/` — Deploy, runbooks, SLOs, oncall
- `docs/adr/` — Decision records (succinct)

Directory layout (target)
- `docs/index.md` — slim ToC pointing to the above
- `docs/frontmatter-standard.md` — source of truth (kept)
- `docs/deprecated/` — archived docs with pointer index
- Remove free‑floating files; each doc belongs to exactly one area.

Deletion vs archive vs keep rules
- Keep: Current IA content that is unique, referenced, or needed for onboarding, ops, or API contracts.
- Archive (move to `docs/deprecated/`):
  - Duplicates, superseded specs, old epic reports, RFCs replaced by ADRs
  - Topic variants with older dates or marked draft
- Delete (hard) if both apply:
  - Auto‑generated or transient artifacts; or empty stubs older than 90 days with no inbound links.

Globs (candidates)
- Archive
  - `docs/**/rfc*/**/*.md`
  - `docs/**/*-draft*.md`
  - `docs/**/epic*/**/*.md`
  - `docs/**/mvp*/**/*.md`
  - `docs/**/legacy*/**/*.md`
  - `docs/**/notes*/**/*.md`
  - `docs/**/specs/*-v{0..1}/*.md`
- Delete
  - `docs/**/.DS_Store`
  - `docs/**/README-old.md`
  - `docs/**/index-old.md`
  - `docs/**/tmp/**/*.md`
  - `docs/**/exports/**/*.md` (if produced by tools; verify no links)
- Keep (move/consolidate)
  - `docs/frontmatter-standard.md`
  - `docs/index.md` (rewrite)
  - `docs/**/api*.md` → `docs/api/`
  - `docs/**/runbook*.md` → `docs/operations/`
  - `docs/**/adr*/**/*.md` → `docs/adr/`

Consolidation patterns
- Merge multi‑part user guides into single authoritative `docs/product/*.md` per domain:
  - `challenges.md`, `validation.md`, `analytics.md`, `adaptive.md`
- Convert long RFCs into concise ADRs (summary, decision, consequences).
- Collapse repeated “how to run dev” into one `docs/getting-started/dev.md`.

Frontmatter normalization
- Required keys: `title, description, status, updated, owner, tags`
- Script (automation, not executed here)
  - `scripts/docs/normalize-frontmatter.(ts|py)` reads `.md`, ensures keys, updates `updated` date, sorts keys.
  - Add `pnpm docs:fmt` to run normalization + `prettier-plugin-md-noc` if used.
- Validation: `markdownlint` custom rules for header order; `markdown-link-check` with config `docs/.mlc.json` (ignore auth‑gated links).

Deprecated index
- `docs/deprecated/index.md` listing each file moved with one‑liner reason and new canonical page.

Docs acceptance criteria
- 40–60% reduction in `docs/**/*.md` count
- `pnpm -w docs:lint && pnpm -w docs:links` passes
- All kept docs match frontmatter standard
- `docs/index.md` reflects slim IA only

**Migration Strategy (Web + Docs)**

Branching and PRs
- PR A: `feat/web-api-client` (Phase 1–2)
- PR B: `feat/web-core-flows` (Phase 3–4)
- PR C: `chore/ci-perf-a11y` (Phase 5)
- PR D: `docs/prune-ia` (Phase 6)
- PR E: `chore/tech-debt-sweep` (Phase 7)

Web migration steps
1. Land typegen + `apiFetch` + queries with a mock page (`/health`).
2. Scaffold App Router IA; attach nav and guards.
3. Replace mock data page‑by‑page with typed queries and mutations.
4. Introduce shared components incrementally; migrate existing local components.
5. Add Playwright smoke and Lighthouse CI; fix regressions before merging.

Docs migration steps
1. Freeze non‑essential doc edits; announce new IA.
2. Move/rename to target directories; create `docs/deprecated/index.md`.
3. Run normalization + link check; fix internal links after moves.
4. Final pass for deletions (no inbound links); update `docs/index.md`.
5. Enable CI checks to prevent new “orphan” docs outside IA.

Rollback plan
- Keep `docs/deprecated/` history; all hard deletes happen only after 1 release with no link references.
- For web, feature‑flag new routes by segment guard; a “legacy” nav can point to prior route if needed during rollout.

**Top 10 Tech Debt Items, Actions, Ownership**

1) API error model inconsistent
- Action: Add `ErrorModel` pydantic and global handlers; document in `docs/api/errors.md`.
- Owner: API

2) OpenAPI→TS typegen is manual
- Action: Pre‑commit + CI step to regenerate; fail build on drift.
- Owner: API + Web

3) Ad‑hoc fetch calls scattered
- Action: Single `apiFetch` + hooks; ban `fetch()` to API via Biome rule.
- Owner: Web

4) Mixed component styles
- Action: Consolidate to shadcn + Radix; codemod imports to `components/ui`.
- Owner: Web

5) No query key convention
- Action: Introduce `queryKeys.ts`; lint rule for hard‑coded arrays.
- Owner: Web

6) Heavy charts blocking main thread
- Action: Dynamic import chart libs; offload transforms to Web Workers if needed.
- Owner: Web

7) Docs sprawl and duplication
- Action: Enforce IA; add docs lint in CI; normalize frontmatter.
- Owner: Docs

8) Unversioned API changes
- Action: Contract tests and schema snapshot in repo; semver label in PRs that touch `/apps/api/src`.
- Owner: API

9) Missing e2e smoke
- Action: Playwright minimal smoke + axe integration.
- Owner: Web QA

10) CORS/auth drift between services
- Action: Centralize CORS settings; add health/auth integration test.
- Owner: Platform

**Directory Moves and Code Mods (Planned, Not Executed)**

Web
- Move components to `apps/web/src/components/{ui,shared}/`
- Create `apps/web/src/lib/{api,auth,utils}/`
- Types: `apps/web/src/types/{api-generated.ts,domain.ts}`

API
- Ensure routers live in `apps/api/src/{validation,challenge,analytics,adaptive}/router.py`
- `apps/api/main.py` includes all routers with clear prefixes

Docs
- Create `docs/{overview,getting-started,product,architecture,api,operations,adr,deprecated}/`
- Move and prune per rules above

Code mods
- Biome rule: disallow `fetch('/api...')` usage outside `lib/api`
- TS aliases in `tsconfig.json` for `@/components`, `@/lib`, `@/types`

Risk mitigation
- Schema snapshot tests; route availability toggle; doc redirects via pointer index.

—

**Commands (Illustrative, Not Executed)**

- Typegen: `python3 apps/api/scripts/generate_types.py > apps/web/src/types/api-generated.ts`
- Dev: `npm run dev` (root orchestrates), `npm run dev:web` (apps/web)
- Build: `pnpm -w --filter @americano/web build`
- Tests: `pnpm -w test && pnpm -w e2e:ci`
- Lint: `pnpm -w lint && pnpm -w docs:lint && pnpm -w docs:links`
- Lighthouse CI example: `lhci autorun --collect.url=http://localhost:3000/dashboard`

**Risks & Mitigations**

- API contract drift → Freeze endpoints for Phase 4; add schema snapshot + contract tests.
- Auth edge cases (token expiry) → Refresh flow via Supabase listener; auto‑retry on 401 once.
- Perf regressions from charts → Lazy load; data windowing and server aggregation.
- Docs link rot → Run link checker in CI; 1‑release grace before hard deletes.
- Team churn on IA → Land shell and nav early; keep routes stable, evolve content behind flags.
