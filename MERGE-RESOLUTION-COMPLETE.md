## Merge Strategy Used

### For Each Conflict Type:

**1. Schema (Prisma):**
- Three-way merge: Epic 5 base + Epic 4 additions
- Resolved model naming conflicts (BehavioralPattern/Insight)
- Result: 77 models, 55 enums, zero duplicates

**2. Package Management:**
- Union merge: ALL dependencies from both epics
- Result: Superset of both Epic 4 and Epic 5 packages

**3. Configuration Files:**
- Merge strategy: Combine sections from both epics
- Examples: .env.example, CLAUDE.md

**4. TypeScript Code:**
- Accept Epic 5 (P0 fixes preserved)
- Programmatic conflict marker removal
- Type regeneration for autogenerated files

**5. Documentation:**
- Accept Epic 5 (more comprehensive)
- Future: Can add Epic 4 specific docs if needed

---

## Verification Results

### 1. ‚úÖ Prisma Client Generation
```bash
npx prisma generate
# ‚úî Generated Prisma Client (v6.17.1) to ./src/generated/prisma in 205ms
```
**Status:** SUCCESS
**Models Generated:** 77
**Enums Generated:** 55

### 2. üîÑ TypeScript Type Check
```bash
npm run typecheck
```
**Status:** IN PROGRESS (regenerating api-generated.ts)
**Issue Found:** Duplicate type identifiers in autogenerated file
**Fix Applied:** Running `npm run generate-types` to regenerate from Python API
**Expected Result:** 0 TypeScript errors after regeneration

### 3. ‚è≥ Package Installation
```bash
pnpm install
```
**Status:** PENDING (recommended after merge commit)
**Purpose:** Regenerate pnpm-lock.yaml with merged dependencies

## Rollback Plan

If catastrophic issues arise after commit:

```bash
# Abort merge (if not yet committed)
git merge --abort
git checkout feature/epic-5-behavioral-twin

# Revert commit (if already committed)
git reset --hard HEAD~1

# Restore from backup
cp /tmp/epic5-schema-backup-20251021-132145.prisma apps/web/prisma/schema.prisma
```

---

## Merge Resolution Methodology

### Guiding Principles:
1. **Preserve Epic 5 P0 Work:** All type safety and test infrastructure fixes must be preserved
2. **Add Epic 4 Features:** All Epic 4 functionality must be integrated
3. **Zero Data Loss:** No models, enums, or fields can be lost
4. **World-Class Quality:** Maintain database design excellence (150+ indexes, full referential integrity)
5. **Minimal Rework:** Use programmatic conflict resolution where possible

### Decision Matrix:
| File Type | Epic 5 Has | Epic 4 Has | Decision |
|-----------|------------|------------|----------|
| P0 Fixes | Yes | No | Accept Epic 5 |
| New Features | No | Yes | Merge Epic 4 |
| Both Have Changes | Yes | Yes | Manual merge (union) |
| Autogenerated | Conflict | Conflict | Regenerate |
| Tests | P0 Fixes | No P0 Fixes | Accept Epic 5 |
| Documentation | More Comprehensive | Less | Accept Epic 5 |
