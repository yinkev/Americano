2. ✅ **LectureFirstAidMapping** - Links lectures to First Aid sections
3. ✅ **FirstAidGuideline** - Stores procedural/protocol guidelines
4. ✅ **FirstAidConceptMapping** - Maps First Aid content to knowledge graph concepts
5. ✅ **FirstAidVersion** - Tracks First Aid edition versions
6. ✅ **FirstAidEdition** - User-specific edition management

**Enums Added:**
1. ✅ **MappingPriority** - HIGH_YIELD, STANDARD, SUGGESTED
2. ✅ **MappingFeedback** - HELPFUL, NOT_HELPFUL, SOMEWHAT_HELPFUL

## Key Schema Features

### 1. Dual Content Models
- **FirstAidSection:** Educational content from First Aid book
- **FirstAidGuideline:** Procedural/protocol content (CPR, emergency procedures)

**Rationale:** Separates learning materials from actionable clinical protocols

### 2. Flexible Concept Mapping
- **FirstAidConceptMapping** supports both guidelines and sections via optional foreign keys
- Enables knowledge graph integration with semantic relationship types

### 3. User-Specific Content Management
- Each user uploads their own First Aid copy (copyright compliance)
- User-specific encryption support via `encryptionKeyHash`
- Access tracking for rate limiting (`accessCount`, `lastAccessedAt`)

### 4. Version Management
- **FirstAidVersion:** Global edition tracking
- **FirstAidEdition:** User-specific edition management with processing status
- Supports multiple editions simultaneously for version comparison

### 5. Semantic Search Support
- Vector embeddings (1536 dimensions) for all content models
- Matches Gemini text-embedding-001 format
- pgvector integration for similarity search

### 6. Confidence Scoring
- Mapping confidence scores (0.0-1.0) enable threshold filtering
- Relevance scores for concept mappings
- CHECK constraints enforce valid ranges

### 7. User Feedback Loop
- `MappingFeedback` enum tracks user validation
- Feedback notes for qualitative improvement
- Supports algorithm refinement over time

---

## Data Integrity

### CHECK Constraints
✅ `first_aid_concept_mappings.relevanceScore` (0.0-1.0)
✅ `lecture_first_aid_mappings.confidence` (0.0-1.0)

### Unique Constraints
✅ `first_aid_guidelines.slug` - Prevents duplicate URLs
✅ `first_aid_versions.edition` - One record per edition
✅ `first_aid_editions.(userId, year)` - One edition per year per user
✅ `lecture_first_aid_mappings.(lectureId, firstAidSectionId)` - No duplicate mappings
✅ `first_aid_concept_mappings` - Conditional uniqueness with WHERE clauses

### Foreign Key Cascades
✅ All mappings CASCADE delete when source content removed
✅ Prevents orphaned records
✅ Maintains referential integrity

---

## Performance Considerations

### Indexes Created
1. **B-tree indexes:** userId, edition, system, category, pageNumber
2. **Composite indexes:** (edition, system), (userId, isActive)
3. **Vector indexes:** For similarity search on embeddings
4. **Partial indexes:** For conditional unique constraints

### Query Optimization
- Confidence thresholds reduce result sets
- `isActive` flag avoids scanning old editions
- Covering indexes minimize table lookups
- Vector indexes use cosine distance operator (<=>)

---

## Security & Compliance

### Copyright Protection
✅ User-specific content (no sharing)
✅ Encryption support via `encryptionKeyHash`
✅ Access tracking for rate limiting
✅ CASCADE delete removes user content

### Privacy
✅ User mappings isolated per user
✅ No cross-user content sharing
✅ Audit trail via timestamps

---

## Migration Strategy

### To Apply Migrations

```bash
# Navigate to web app directory
cd /Users/kyin/Projects/Americano-epic3/apps/web
