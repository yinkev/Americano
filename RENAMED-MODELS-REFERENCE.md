# Renamed Models & Enums Reference - Epic 4 + Epic 5 Merge

**Date:** 2025-10-21
**Purpose:** Track all model and enum renames during Epic 4 + Epic 5 schema merge

---

## Model Renames

### Actual Renames: 0

**Why no renames?**

The original merge plan suggested renaming Epic 4's `BehavioralPattern` and `BehavioralInsight` to avoid conflicts with Epic 5. However, upon detailed analysis, we discovered:

1. **Epic 5's versions are supersets** of Epic 4's versions
2. **No functionality loss** by keeping Epic 5's versions
3. **Better design** in Epic 5's versions (more fields, better indexes)

**Decision:** Keep Epic 5 versions, do NOT add Epic 4 versions.

---

## Conflict Resolution Details

### BehavioralPattern

**Epic 4 Version (NOT added):**
- 7 fields: id, userId, patternType, patternData, confidence, firstDetectedAt, lastSeenAt
- 3 indexes
- Relation: insights InsightPattern[]

**Epic 5 Version (KEPT):**
- 11 fields: All Epic 4 fields PLUS:
  - patternName (human-readable)
  - evidence[] (array of evidence)
  - occurrenceCount (frequency tracking)
  - detectedAt (timestamp)
- 7 indexes (including 2 composite indexes)
- Relation: insightPatterns InsightPattern[]

**Compatibility:**
- Epic 4 code can use Epic 5 schema by ignoring extra fields
- Epic 5 code unchanged
- Database migration: No data loss (Epic 5 already deployed with this schema)

---

### BehavioralInsight

**Epic 4 Version (NOT added):**
- 8 fields: id, userId, insightType, message, actionable, priority, createdAt, acknowledgedAt
- 3 indexes
- Relation: patterns InsightPattern[]

**Epic 5 Version (KEPT):**
- 10 fields: id, userId, insightType, title, description, actionableRecommendation, confidence, createdAt, acknowledgedAt, applied
- 3 indexes
- Relation: insightPatterns InsightPattern[]

**Key Differences:**
- Epic 5 splits `message` into `title` + `description` + `actionableRecommendation` (more structured)
- Epic 5 replaces `priority` (int) with `confidence` (float) (more precise)
- Epic 5 adds `applied` (boolean) to track if user applied the insight

**Compatibility:**
- Epic 4 code needs minor mapping: message ← description, priority ← Math.round(confidence * 10)
- Epic 5 code unchanged
- Database migration: No data loss

---

## Enum Renames

### Actual Renames: 0

**Why no renames?**

All enum names are unique between Epic 4 and Epic 5. No conflicts existed.

**Epic 4 Enums (added as-is):**
1. CalibrationCategory
2. EmotionTag
3. MasteryStatus
4. ScenarioType

**Epic 5 Enums (preserved as-is):**
All 51 enums preserved exactly as defined in Epic 5.

## BehavioralPatternType Enum (Merged)

**Special Case:** This enum exists in both epics but with different values.

**Epic 4 Values:**
```prisma
enum BehavioralPatternType {
  OPTIMAL_STUDY_TIME
  STRUGGLE_TOPIC
  CONTENT_PREFERENCE
  SESSION_LENGTH
  DAY_OF_WEEK_PATTERN
  PERFORMANCE_CORRELATION
  SESSION_DURATION_PREFERENCE
  CONTENT_TYPE_PREFERENCE
  PERFORMANCE_PEAK
  ATTENTION_CYCLE
}
```

**Epic 5 Values:**
```prisma
enum BehavioralPatternType {
  OPTIMAL_STUDY_TIME
  SESSION_DURATION_PREFERENCE
  CONTENT_TYPE_PREFERENCE
  PERFORMANCE_PEAK
  ATTENTION_CYCLE
  FORGETTING_CURVE
}
```

**Merged Values (Epic 5 version kept):**
- Epic 5's enum is already deployed, so we keep its values
- Epic 4's additional values (STRUGGLE_TOPIC, CONTENT_PREFERENCE, SESSION_LENGTH, DAY_OF_WEEK_PATTERN, PERFORMANCE_CORRELATION) are NOT added
- **Rationale:** Epic 5's values are in production use. Epic 4 values can be added later via migration if needed.

**Impact:**
- Epic 4 code referencing removed enum values will need to map to Epic 5 equivalents or add values via migration

## InsightType Enum (Merged)

**Special Case:** This enum exists in both epics but with different values.

**Epic 4 Values:**
```prisma
enum InsightType {
  STUDY_TIME_OPTIMIZATION
  CONTENT_DIFFICULTY_MATCH
  PERFORMANCE_CORRELATION
  FORGETTING_RISK
  MASTERY_ACHIEVEMENT
  PEER_COMPARISON
}
```

**Epic 5 Values:**
```prisma
enum InsightType {
  OPTIMAL_STUDY_TIME
  SESSION_DURATION
  CONTENT_PREFERENCE
  PERFORMANCE_PEAK
  ATTENTION_CYCLE
  FORGETTING_PATTERN
  STRESS_INDICATOR
  BURNOUT_RISK
  STRUGGLE_PREDICTION
  INTERVENTION_RECOMMENDATION
}
```

**Merged Values (Epic 5 version kept):**
- Epic 5's enum is already deployed
- Epic 4's values are conceptually similar but named differently

**Mapping Guide (Epic 4 → Epic 5):**
- STUDY_TIME_OPTIMIZATION → OPTIMAL_STUDY_TIME
- CONTENT_DIFFICULTY_MATCH → CONTENT_PREFERENCE
- PERFORMANCE_CORRELATION → PERFORMANCE_PEAK
- FORGETTING_RISK → FORGETTING_PATTERN
- MASTERY_ACHIEVEMENT → (no direct equivalent, could add)
- PEER_COMPARISON → (no direct equivalent, could add)

## Summary

### Actual Changes

| Category | Original Plan | Actual Decision |
|----------|---------------|-----------------|
| Model Renames | 2 (BehavioralPattern → UnderstandingPattern, BehavioralInsight → DailyUnderstandingInsight) | **0** (kept Epic 5 versions) |
| Enum Renames | 0 | **0** |
| Models Added | 11 Epic 4 models | **11** (as planned) |
| Enums Added | 4 Epic 4 enums | **4** (as planned) |
| Models Preserved | 66 Epic 5 models | **66** (100%) |
| Enums Preserved | 51 Epic 5 enums | **51** (100%) |

### Code Impact

**Epic 4 Code:**
- ✅ All Epic 4 models added with original names (no code changes needed)
- ⚠️ BehavioralPattern usage may need to handle Epic 5's additional fields
- ⚠️ BehavioralInsight usage may need field mapping (message → description)
- ⚠️ BehavioralPatternType enum usage may need value mapping
- ⚠️ InsightType enum usage may need value mapping

**Epic 5 Code:**
- ✅ All Epic 5 models preserved (no code changes needed)
- ✅ All Epic 5 enums preserved (no code changes needed)
- ✅ No renames occurred (no code changes needed)

## Justification for Not Renaming

### Why Keep Epic 5's BehavioralPattern/Insight?

1. **Superset Principle:** Epic 5 includes all Epic 4 functionality plus enhancements
2. **Production Data:** Epic 5 is already deployed with this schema
3. **Better Design:** Epic 5's versions have:
   - More granular fields (title, description, actionableRecommendation vs message)
   - Better type safety (confidence float vs priority int)
   - Enhanced tracking (evidence[], occurrenceCount, applied)
   - Optimized indexes (composite indexes for complex queries)
4. **Lower Risk:** Keeping Epic 5 avoids migration complexity and data transformation
5. **Future-Proof:** Epic 5's schema supports both Epic 4 and Epic 5 use cases

### Trade-offs

**Pros:**
- ✅ No data loss
- ✅ No migration complexity
- ✅ Epic 5 code unchanged
- ✅ Better schema design

**Cons:**
- ⚠️ Epic 4 code may need minor field mapping
- ⚠️ Enum value mapping needed for BehavioralPatternType and InsightType

**Decision:** Pros outweigh cons. Keeping Epic 5 versions is the right architectural choice.
