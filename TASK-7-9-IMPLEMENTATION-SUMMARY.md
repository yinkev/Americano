✅ **Frontend-developer agent (Task 7):**
- Read AGENTS.MD and CLAUDE.MD
- Fetched latest docs from context7 MCP for:
  - React 19
  - Next.js 15 App Router
  - @xyflow/react (React Flow v12+)
  - shadcn/ui components
  - Tailwind CSS v4
- Announced doc fetching explicitly
- Used only verified current patterns

✅ **Performance-engineer agent (Task 8):**
- Read AGENTS.MD and CLAUDE.MD
- Fetched latest docs from context7 MCP for:
  - React 19 performance optimization
  - Next.js 15 caching
  - @xyflow/react optimization
  - Zustand state management
- Announced doc fetching explicitly
- Documented performance benchmarks

⚠️ **Test-automator agent (Task 9):**

## Known Issues and Risks

### Issue 1: Test-automator Agent Token Limit Exceeded
**Severity:** Medium
**Impact:** Manual testing required
**Mitigation:** Create manual test checklist and execute QA validation before story approval

### Issue 2: TypeScript Error in jest.setup.ts (Pre-existing)
**Severity:** Low
**Impact:** Build succeeds but type error present
**Mitigation:** Not related to Task 7-9 implementation, can be addressed separately

### Risk 1: Large Graph Performance (500+ nodes)
**Current Status:** Task 8 tested up to 500 nodes (2.5s load time)
**Mitigation:** WebGL rendering and clustering deferred to post-MVP

### Risk 2: Real-Time Updates Bandwidth
**Current Status:** 30s polling (~200 bytes/poll = ~6KB/min)
**Mitigation:** Acceptable for MVP, consider Server-Sent Events (SSE) for production

---

## Future Enhancements (Deferred)

### Task 8 Enhancements:
1. **WebGL Rendering** - For graphs >500 nodes
2. **Graph Clustering** - For graphs >1000 nodes
3. **Server-Sent Events (SSE)** - For instant real-time updates
4. **Performance Monitoring Dashboard** - Real-time metrics visualization

### Task 9 Enhancements:
1. **Automated Unit Tests** - For KnowledgeGraphBuilder and API routes
2. **E2E Tests with Playwright** - For full user flow validation
3. **Performance Regression Tests** - Automated benchmarking in CI/CD
4. **Visual Regression Tests** - Screenshot comparison for UI changes
