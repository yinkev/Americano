   - Comprehensive Jest test suite
   - 27 test cases covering all functionality

---

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. Main Routing Function: `generateFollowUp()`
- **Score < 60%**: Routes to prerequisite follow-up (difficulty -20)
- **Score > 85%**: Routes to advanced follow-up (difficulty +20)
- **Score 60-85%**: No follow-up generated (continue main assessment)
- Enforces max 2 follow-ups per original question
- Returns detailed rationale for each decision

### 2. Prerequisite Question Finding: `generatePrerequisiteFollowUp()`
- Queries `ObjectivePrerequisite` join table for foundational concepts
- Selects strongest prerequisite (highest strength value)
- Returns objectiveId for use in question generation
- Null-safe: Returns null if no prerequisites exist

### 3. Advanced Question Finding: `generateAdvancedFollowUp()`
- **Strategy 1**: Reverse prerequisite lookup (finds dependent objectives)
- **Strategy 2**: Complexity progression (BASIC â†’ INTERMEDIATE â†’ ADVANCED)
- Prioritizes dependents over complexity when both available
- Queries same course for related advanced concepts

### 4. Follow-Up Limiting: `limitFollowUps()`
- Enforces max 2 follow-ups per original question
- Counts existing follow-up responses in database
- Returns detailed result with current count and reason
- Prevents follow-up spam while allowing depth

### 5. Difficulty Adjustment: `calculateFollowUpDifficulty()`
- Prerequisite: -20 points (easier)
- Advanced: +20 points (harder)
- Clamps to 0-100 range
- Clean, predictable difficulty progression

### 6. UI Context Generation: `getFollowUpContext()`
- Provides user-friendly explanations
- Prerequisite: "Building Foundation" with book emoji ðŸ“š
- Advanced: "Deeper Challenge" with rocket emoji ðŸš€
- Includes score and rationale in description

---

## Database Integration

### Queries Used

1. **ValidationPrompt.findUnique()**
   - Get parent prompt's objectiveId
   - Check if prompt has linked objective

2. **ValidationResponse.count()**
   - Count existing follow-ups for limit enforcement
   - Filter by userId, parentPromptId, isFollowUpQuestion

3. **ObjectivePrerequisite.findMany()**
   - **For prerequisites**: WHERE objectiveId (current) â†’ get prerequisite concepts
   - **For advanced**: WHERE prerequisiteId (current) â†’ get dependent concepts
   - Order by strength (highest first)

4. **LearningObjective.findUnique()**
   - Get current objective's complexity and course
   - Used for complexity progression strategy

5. **LearningObjective.findMany()**
   - Find higher complexity objectives in same course
   - Fallback when no dependent objectives exist

### Database Schema Requirements

All required fields exist in Prisma schema:
- âœ… `ValidationResponse.isFollowUpQuestion` (boolean)
- âœ… `ValidationResponse.parentPromptId` (string, indexed)
- âœ… `ValidationPrompt.objectiveId` (string)
- âœ… `ObjectivePrerequisite` join table (objectiveId, prerequisiteId, strength)
- âœ… `LearningObjective.complexity` (BASIC, INTERMEDIATE, ADVANCED)

## Acceptance Criteria Coverage

### AC#3: Knowledge Graph-Based Follow-Up Questions

âœ… **Query Knowledge Graph for related concepts**
- Uses ObjectivePrerequisite join table (MVP approach per Story 4.5 constraints)
- Future: Will use full Knowledge Graph when Story 3.2 is implemented

âœ… **Identify prerequisite concepts if score < 60%**
- `findPrerequisiteQuestions()` queries ObjectivePrerequisite table
- Returns strongest prerequisite for easier follow-up question

âœ… **Identify advanced applications if score > 85%**
- `findAdvancedQuestions()` uses two strategies:
  1. Reverse prerequisite lookup (finds dependents)
  2. Complexity progression (higher complexity in same course)

âœ… **Generate follow-up targeting identified concept**
- Returns `relatedObjectiveId` for question generation
- Provides difficulty adjustment (-20 or +20)
- Includes rationale for UI display

âœ… **Adapt question type (prerequisite/lateral/advanced)**
- Clear distinction between 'prerequisite' and 'advanced' types
- Moderate scores (60-85%) result in 'none' (no follow-up)

âœ… **Maximum 2 follow-ups per original prompt**
- `limitFollowUps()` enforces this constraint
- Counts existing follow-ups in database
- Returns clear reason when limit reached

âœ… **Allow users to skip if time-constrained**
- Returns `shouldGenerateFollowUp` boolean
- UI can provide skip option based on this flag
- Follow-up is optional, not mandatory

---

## Integration Points

### Upstream Dependencies
- âœ… Story 4.1: ValidationPrompt, ValidationResponse models
- âœ… Story 2.1: ObjectivePrerequisite join table, LearningObjective model
- âœ… Story 4.4: Confidence calibration (not directly used but complementary)

### Downstream Usage
- ðŸ”„ Story 4.5 Task 10: Adaptive Session Orchestrator (will call this generator)
- ðŸ”„ Story 4.5 Task 11: Question Bank Manager (will use relatedObjectiveId)
- ðŸ”„ Story 4.5 Task 12: API route `/api/adaptive/question/next` (will integrate)

---

## Technical Decisions

### 1. TypeScript-Only Implementation
- **Decision**: Implemented in TypeScript (not Python)
- **Rationale**: Follow-up logic is business rules, not heavy computation
- **Benefit**: Tighter integration with Next.js API routes and Prisma
- **Note**: Per CLAUDE.md, Python would be used if ML-based pattern detection needed

### 2. ObjectivePrerequisite for MVP
- **Decision**: Use ObjectivePrerequisite join table instead of full Knowledge Graph
- **Rationale**: Story 3.2 (Knowledge Graph) not yet implemented
- **Future**: Easy migration when Knowledge Graph available (just change query logic)

### 3. Max 2 Follow-Ups Limit
- **Decision**: Hard limit of 2 follow-ups per original question
- **Rationale**: Prevents follow-up chains from dominating assessment
- **Benefit**: Keeps sessions focused and time-efficient

### 4. Score Thresholds (60%, 85%)
- **Decision**: Clear thresholds for routing decisions
- **Rationale**: Aligns with Story 4.5 AC#3 specifications
- **Benefit**: Predictable, testable behavior

## Example Usage

```typescript
import { FollowUpQuestionGenerator } from '@/lib/follow-up-question-generator'

const generator = new FollowUpQuestionGenerator()

// User answered with score 45% (struggling)
const result = await generator.generateFollowUp('parent-prompt-123', 45, 'user-1')

console.log(result)
// {
//   shouldGenerateFollowUp: true,
//   followUpType: 'prerequisite',
//   relatedObjectiveId: 'prereq-obj-456',
//   difficultyAdjustment: -20,
//   rationale: 'Low score (45%) - generating easier prerequisite question to build foundation'
// }

// User answered with score 92% (excelling)
const result2 = await generator.generateFollowUp('parent-prompt-456', 92, 'user-1')

console.log(result2)
// {
//   shouldGenerateFollowUp: true,
//   followUpType: 'advanced',
//   relatedObjectiveId: 'adv-obj-789',
//   difficultyAdjustment: 20,
//   rationale: 'Excellent score (92%) - generating advanced question for deeper mastery'
// }

// User answered with score 75% (good, no follow-up)
const result3 = await generator.generateFollowUp('parent-prompt-789', 75, 'user-1')

console.log(result3)
// {
//   shouldGenerateFollowUp: false,
//   followUpType: 'none',
//   relatedObjectiveId: null,
//   difficultyAdjustment: 0,
//   rationale: 'Good score (75%) - no follow-up needed, continuing main assessment'
// }
```

## Next Steps

### Integration Tasks

1. **Story 4.5 Task 10**: Adaptive Session Orchestrator
   - Call `generateFollowUp()` after each assessment response
   - Use `relatedObjectiveId` to fetch next question
   - Display follow-up context in UI

2. **Story 4.5 Task 11**: Question Bank Manager
   - Accept `relatedObjectiveId` parameter
   - Filter questions by objective and difficulty
   - Apply `difficultyAdjustment` when selecting question

3. **Story 4.5 Task 12**: API Route Integration
   - Add follow-up generation to `/api/adaptive/question/next`
   - Return follow-up metadata in response
   - Save `isFollowUpQuestion` and `parentPromptId` in database

4. **Story 4.5 Task 13**: UI Components
   - Display follow-up context (title, description, icon)
   - Show "Skip follow-up" option when `shouldGenerateFollowUp` is true
   - Visual indicator when question is a follow-up (badge or label)

### Future Enhancements

1. **Knowledge Graph Integration** (Story 3.2)
   - Replace ObjectivePrerequisite queries with full graph traversal
   - Enable lateral follow-ups (related but not prerequisite/advanced)
   - Cross-course concept connections

2. **ML-Based Follow-Up Selection** (Post-MVP)
   - Analyze historical follow-up effectiveness
   - Predict which follow-up type helps most per user
   - Personalize prerequisite/advanced thresholds

3. **Dynamic Follow-Up Limits**
   - Adjust max follow-ups based on time remaining in session
   - Allow more follow-ups for high-value concepts
   - Track follow-up ROI (improvement after follow-up)
