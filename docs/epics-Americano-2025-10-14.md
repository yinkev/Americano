## Implementation Notes

### Development Priorities
**Critical Path:** Epic 1 → Epic 2 (MVP) → Epic 3 → Epic 4 → Epic 5
**Parallel Development:** UX design concurrent with Epic 1, Architecture planning before any development

### Technical Dependencies
- **Epic 1:** Foundation for all subsequent development
- **Epic 2:** Depends on Epic 1 completion, enables core value proposition
- **Epic 3:** Can begin after Epic 1, concurrent with Epic 2 completion
- **Epic 4:** Requires significant Epic 2 data, can begin after Epic 2 MVP
- **Epic 5:** Requires 6+ weeks user behavior data, begins after Epic 4 foundation

### Success Metrics Framework
**User Adoption:** Weekly retention >85%, daily usage >45 minutes
**Academic Impact:** Measurable correlation with course performance improvement
**Platform Efficiency:** Study planning time reduced by 25%+, platform switching reduced by 40%+
**Business Validation:** User satisfaction >4.0/5, willingness to pay >60% of users

### Risk Mitigation
**Technical Risks:** AI API dependencies mitigated through fallback systems and local caching
**User Adoption Risks:** Phased rollout starting with founder validation, then close peers
**Performance Risks:** Scalable architecture design from foundation, performance monitoring throughout
