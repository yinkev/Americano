### Key Features
1. **Comprehension Prompts** (Story 4.1) - AI-powered evaluation with ChatMock/GPT-5
2. **Clinical Reasoning** (Story 4.2) - Scenario-based validation for medical students
3. **Controlled Failure** (Story 4.3) - Challenge generation based on misconceptions
4. **Calibration Analytics** (Story 4.4) - Confidence vs performance tracking
5. **Adaptive Questioning** (Story 4.5) - IRT-based difficulty adjustment
6. **Analytics Dashboard** (Story 4.6) - Validation insights with Recharts

## Architecture Highlights

**Hybrid TypeScript + Python Architecture:**
- **Python FastAPI Service** (port 8000) - AI evaluation, prompt generation, ML analytics
- **TypeScript Next.js** (port 3000) - UI, API proxy, database operations
- **AI Integration:** `instructor` library for Pydantic-validated ChatMock/GPT-5 responses
- **Database:** Prisma ORM with PostgreSQL
- **Charts:** Recharts for analytics visualization

### Python Responsibilities
- All ChatMock/GPT-5 AI evaluation with structured outputs
- Prompt generation with variation
- Scoring calculations (rubric-based, statistical)
- Pattern detection and analytics
- Future ML/statistical analysis (scipy, scikit-learn)

### TypeScript Responsibilities
- All UI components (Dialogs, Charts, Forms)
- Next.js API routes (proxy to Python service)
- Session orchestration and state management
- Prisma database operations
- Real-time user interactions
