**Mitigation:** Personal use only, user ownership verification, encryption, no redistribution
**Future:** Explore official partnership with McGraw Hill for licensing

### 2. Mapping Accuracy
**Limitation:** Semantic matching is probabilistic, not perfect (target: >80% precision)
**Mitigation:** Manual review queue, user feedback loop, confidence scoring
**Future:** Improve algorithm with user feedback data

### 3. Graph Complexity
**Limitation:** Large graphs (>500 concepts) may be cluttered
**Mitigation:** Clustering, pagination, hierarchical views
**Future:** Implement WebGL rendering for >1000 nodes

### 4. Conflict False Positives
**Limitation:** GPT-5 may flag terminology differences as conflicts
**Mitigation:** Severity classification, user feedback, tuned prompts
**Future:** Train model on medical terminology corpus

**Limitation:** No multi-user support, authentication deferred
**Mitigation:** Documented migration path for production deployment
**Future:** Implement authentication, rate limiting, user isolation

---

## Technical Debt

### Addressed During Epic 3

1. **Neon Database Dependency** - Removed unauthorized @neondatabase/serverless package, replaced with Prisma
2. **TypeScript Errors** - Resolved 81 TypeScript errors (vector type assertions, import paths, ZodError API changes)
3. **JSON Parsing Errors** - Fixed /missions page defensive error handling
4. **Design System** - Enforced OKLCH colors, glassmorphism, NO gradients across all components
5. **AGENTS.MD Protocol** - Strengthened dependency approval process to prevent future incidents

### Remaining for Future Sprints

1. **Automated Testing** - Deferred for MVP (manual testing sufficient), comprehensive test suite recommended pre-production
2. **Rate Limiting** - Documented but not implemented (single-user MVP), critical for multi-user deployment
3. **Authentication** - Deferred per architecture guidance, required for production
4. **Performance Optimization** - Graph virtualization, WebGL rendering for >1000 nodes
5. **ML Model Training** - Conflict detection and recommendation algorithms can be improved with user feedback data

## Architecture Decisions

### 1. Vector Embeddings
**Decision:** Use Gemini text-embedding-001 (1536 dimensions) instead of 3072
**Rationale:** pgvector 0.8.1 has 2000-dimension limit, 1536 provides excellent quality with 50% storage savings
**Impact:** Enables semantic search without requiring pgvector upgrade

### 2. React Flow for Visualization
**Decision:** Use @xyflow/react v12 for knowledge graph visualization
**Rationale:** Industry-standard, actively maintained, supports force-directed layouts and custom nodes/edges
**Impact:** Enables interactive concept mapping with excellent performance

### 3. Hybrid Recommendation Algorithm
**Decision:** Combine content-based (70%) and collaborative filtering (30%)
**Rationale:** Balances semantic similarity with user behavior patterns
**Impact:** Provides personalized recommendations while maintaining diversity

### 4. First Aid Section-Based Chunking
**Decision:** Chunk First Aid at section level (not arbitrary tokens)
**Rationale:** Preserves semantic units and hierarchical structure
**Impact:** Improves mapping accuracy and user experience

### 5. GPT-5 for Conflict Detection
**Decision:** Use ChatMock GPT-5 for medical context-aware conflict analysis
**Rationale:** Medical terminology requires domain expertise, rule-based systems insufficient
**Impact:** Accurate conflict detection with severity classification

### 6. IVFFlat Index for Vector Search
**Decision:** Use IVFFlat index for approximate nearest neighbor search
**Rationale:** Fast queries (<100ms) with acceptable accuracy tradeoff
**Impact:** Enables <1s search latency at scale, upgrade path to HNSW if accuracy drops

## Lessons Learned

### What Worked Well
1. **Parallel Agent Execution** - Multiple agents working simultaneously accelerated development
2. **Context7 MCP Integration** - Fetching latest docs prevented outdated API usage
3. **Comprehensive Context Files** - story-context.xml files provided clear implementation blueprints
4. **AGENTS.MD Protocol** - Enforced best practices and prevented technical debt
5. **Incremental Delivery** - Each story built on previous infrastructure (EmbeddingService, SemanticSearchService)
6. **Design System Compliance** - Consistent OKLCH colors, glassmorphism, NO gradients across all components

### What Didn't Work
1. **Unauthorized Dependencies** - Neon database package added without approval (incident documented)
2. **TypeScript Errors Accumulation** - 81 errors from previous stories required cleanup
3. **JSON Parsing Errors** - /missions page error required defensive error handling
4. **Documentation Drift** - Gemini embedding dimension mismatch (3072 vs 1536) caused confusion

### Improvements for Future Epics
1. **Stricter Dependency Approval** - AGENTS.MD protocol now enforces user approval for all new dependencies
2. **Continuous TypeScript Validation** - Run `tsc --noEmit` after each story to catch errors early
3. **Defensive Error Handling** - Always wrap JSON.parse() in try-catch blocks
4. **Documentation Verification** - Use context7 MCP to verify API specs before documenting
5. **Incident Reports** - Document all protocol violations with root cause analysis and prevention measures
