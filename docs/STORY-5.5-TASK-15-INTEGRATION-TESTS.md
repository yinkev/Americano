- Story 5.2 (Struggle Predictions): Active predictions, intervention recommendations
- Story 5.3 (Session Orchestration): Timing recommendations, adherence rates
- Story 5.4 (Cognitive Load): Current load, burnout risk, stress patterns
- Data quality scoring (0.0-1.0 based on source availability)

### 2. End-to-End Mission Personalization Workflow (3 tests)
- **Test 2.1:** Fully personalized mission generation with all Epic 5 data
- **Test 2.2:** Cognitive load override for high-load scenarios (Story 5.4)
- **Test 2.3:** Critical burnout risk prioritization

**Integration Points Validated:**
- Story 5.1 → Optimal session duration (50 min)
- Story 5.2 → High-priority interventions (priority ≥7)
- Story 5.3 → Recommended start time (7:00 AM)
- Story 5.4 → Intensity reduction for high load/burnout
- Confidence scoring based on data availability (0.95+ with full data)

### 3. Multi-Armed Bandit Strategy Selection (3 tests)
- **Test 3.1:** Epsilon-greedy algorithm (90% exploit, 10% explore)

## Key Design Decisions

### 1. Story Priority Order
The PersonalizationEngine applies story insights in this order:
1. Story 5.3 (Orchestration) → Recommended start time + duration
2. Story 5.4 (Cognitive Load) → Safety overrides (burnout, high load)
3. Story 5.2 (Struggle Predictions) → Intervention inclusion
4. Story 5.1 (Learning Patterns) → Optimal duration (if confidence ≥0.7)

**Rationale:** Story 5.4 safety overrides are applied before Story 5.1 preferences, but Story 5.1 can still override if confidence is high (≥0.7). This allows user-proven optimal durations to take precedence unless cognitive load is concerning.

### 2. Confidence Threshold
- **Minimum confidence:** 0.7 (70%)
- **Minimum data quality:** 0.6 (60%)

**Rationale:** Balances personalization benefits against noise from low-quality data. Research-grade standard for actionable insights.

### 3. Multi-Armed Bandit Configuration
- **Algorithm:** Epsilon-greedy
- **Epsilon:** 0.1 (10% exploration)
- **Confidence adjustment:** Multiplicative (`score * confidence`)

**Rationale:** Simple, proven, and interpretable. 10% exploration prevents strategy lock-in while maximizing exploitation of best-performing strategies.

### 4. A/B Testing Statistical Rigor
- **Minimum sample size:** Experiment-defined (e.g., 100 users)
- **Significance test:** Two-sample t-test
- **Alpha level:** 0.05 (95% confidence)

**Rationale:** Industry-standard statistical methods. Prevents premature conclusions from insufficient data.
