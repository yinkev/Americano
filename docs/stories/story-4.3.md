# Story 4.3: Controlled Failure and Memory Anchoring

Status: Done

## Story

As a medical student,
I want to experience controlled failures that reveal my knowledge gaps,
so that I can anchor corrective learning in memorable emotional moments and prevent future errors.

## Context

**Epic:** Epic 4 - Understanding Validation Engine
**Priority:** High (Third story in Epic 4, cognitive psychology-based learning)
**Dependencies:** Story 4.1 (Comprehension Prompts), Story 4.2 (Clinical Scenarios), Story 2.2 (Performance Tracking)

**Business Value:** Unique learning psychology feature - leverages failure as learning tool, creates memorable "aha moments" that improve long-term retention. Differentiates from passive study tools.

**User Value:** Identify blind spots before exam day, create emotional anchors for difficult concepts, reduce exam anxiety through safe failure experience.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **AC#1 - Intentional Challenge Generation**: System identifies concepts user thinks they know but likely misunderstands
   - Analyzes performance patterns (high confidence + low scores = overconfidence)
   - Targets concepts with partial understanding (60-79% comprehension scores)
   - Generates challenging questions designed to expose misconceptions
   - Uses "near-miss" distractors (plausible but incorrect)

2. **AC#2 - Safe Failure Environment**: User experiences productive failure without penalty
   - Failures don't affect mastery level or mission completion negatively
   - Explicit framing: "Challenge Mode - designed to be difficult"
   - Unlimited retry attempts encouraged
   - Growth mindset messaging ("This is where learning happens!")

3. **AC#3 - Immediate Corrective Feedback**: System provides detailed explanation immediately after incorrect response
   - Highlights why user's answer was wrong (misconception explained)
   - Explains correct answer with clinical context
   - Connects to related concepts user already understands
   - Provides memorable analogy or clinical pearl

4. **AC#4 - Emotional Anchoring**: System creates memorable learning moments from failures
   - Tags failed attempt with emotion marker (surprise, confusion, frustration)
   - Generates memorable mnemonic or visual analogy
   - Creates "story" around the concept (patient case narrative)
   - User can add personal notes about what clicked

5. **AC#5 - Spaced Re-Testing**: System re-tests previously failed concepts at strategic intervals
   - Schedule follow-up at 1 day, 3 days, 7 days, 14 days
   - Uses slightly different question format (prevent memorization)
   - Tracks improvement: Initial failure â†’ Eventual mastery
   - Celebrates success on retry ("You've conquered this!")

6. **AC#6 - Performance Pattern Analysis**: System identifies common failure patterns and misconceptions
   - Groups failed concepts by category (e.g., "pharmacology drug classes")
   - Detects systematic errors (e.g., always confusing sympathetic vs parasympathetic)
   - Recommends targeted review resources
   - Displays "Your Common Pitfalls" dashboard

7. **AC#7 - Confidence Recalibration**: System helps user recognize and correct overconfidence
   - Shows discrepancy: "You felt Confident (4/5) but scored 45%"
   - Tracks calibration improvement over time
   - Nudges toward realistic self-assessment
   - Displays calibration accuracy trend (improving/stable/worsening)

8. **AC#8 - Integration with Session Flow**: Controlled failure challenges appear strategically during sessions
   - Frequency: 1 challenge per session (avoid fatigue)
   - Timing: After warm-up, before peak focus (optimal for memory encoding)
   - Optional: User can opt-out if not ready for challenge
   - Results included in Session Summary with growth mindset framing

## Dev Notes

### Architecture Context

**Subsystem:** Understanding Validation Engine (Epic 4)
**Dependencies:**
- **Story 4.1**: ValidationPrompt/ValidationResponse infrastructure
- **Story 4.2**: Clinical scenarios (can be used as challenge sources)
- **Story 2.2**: Performance metrics (vulnerability identification)
- **Story 2.5**: Session orchestration (integration point)

**Cognitive Psychology Principles:**
- **Desirable Difficulty**: Challenges should be hard but achievable
- **Emotional Encoding**: Emotion strengthens memory formation
- **Testing Effect**: Retrieval practice (even failed) improves retention
- **Spaced Repetition**: Retries at expanding intervals optimize retention

### Technical Implementation Notes

**1. Vulnerability Scoring Algorithm:**
```typescript
function calculateVulnerability(objective: Objective, user: User): number {
  const overconfidenceScore = user.avgConfidence - user.avgPerformance; // High = overconfident
  const partialUnderstanding = objective.comprehensionScore >= 60 && objective.comprehensionScore < 80;
  const recentMistakes = objective.failuresLast7Days;

  return (
    (overconfidenceScore * 0.4) +
    (partialUnderstanding ? 30 : 0) * 0.3 +
    (recentMistakes * 10) * 0.3
  );
}
```

**2. Challenge Generation Prompt (ChatMock):**
```
Generate a challenging question for this medical concept that exposes common misconceptions.

Concept: [objective text]
User Vulnerability: [overconfidence / partial understanding / recent mistakes]

Requirements:
- Use "near-miss" distractors (plausible but subtly incorrect)
- Target common confusion points
- Difficulty: Should be challenging for someone with partial understanding
- Format: Multiple choice with 4-5 options
- Include brief clinical vignette if applicable

Output:
- Question text
- 4-5 answer options (1 correct, 3-4 near-miss distractors)
- Correct answer
- Explanation of common misconception
```

**3. Retry Schedule:**
```typescript
const retryIntervals = [1, 3, 7, 14, 30]; // days

function scheduleRetries(failureDate: Date): Date[] {
  return retryIntervals.map(days => addDays(failureDate, days));
}
```

**4. Emotion-Anchored Memory Encoding:**
- Research shows emotional events have stronger memory traces
- User tags failure with emotion â†’ Creates stronger memory anchor
- Follow-up prompt: "What was the 'aha moment' for you?"
- Store user's personal connection to concept

**5. Growth Mindset Messaging:**
```typescript
const growthMessages = {
  failure: "This is where learning happens! Let's break down what went wrong.",
  retry: "You're getting stronger with each attempt!",
  mastery: "You've conquered this concept! ðŸŽ‰ From failure to mastery.",
  challenge: "This is designed to be difficult - embrace the challenge!"
};
```

### Design System Compliance

- **Challenge Colors** (OKLCH):
  - Challenge Mode: `oklch(0.72 0.16 45)` (Orange - indicates difficulty)
  - Failure: `oklch(0.65 0.20 25)` (Red - but framed positively)
  - Aha Moment: `oklch(0.75 0.12 85)` (Yellow - insight)
  - Mastery: `oklch(0.7 0.15 145)` (Green - success)

- **Growth Mindset UI**:
  - Avoid punitive red (use orange for challenges)
  - Celebrate progress bars (failure â†’ retry â†’ mastery)
  - Positive framing language throughout
  - Trophy/badge icons for mastery achievements
