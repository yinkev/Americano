### Key Algorithms

**Cognitive Load Calculation:**
```typescript
function calculateCognitiveLoad(sessionData: SessionData): number {
  const responseLatency = calculateResponseLatencyScore(sessionData.responseTimes)  // 0-100
  const errorRate = (sessionData.errors / sessionData.totalAttempts) * 100
  const engagementDrop = calculateEngagementDrop(sessionData.pauses, sessionData.duration)
  const performanceDecline = calculatePerformanceDecline(sessionData.currentScore, sessionData.baselineScore)
  const durationStress = calculateDurationStress(sessionData.sessionDuration)

  const loadScore = (
    responseLatency * 0.30 +
    errorRate * 0.25 +
    engagementDrop * 0.20 +
    performanceDecline * 0.15 +
    durationStress * 0.10
  )

  return Math.min(100, Math.max(0, loadScore))
}

function calculateResponseLatencyScore(responseTimes: number[]): number {
  const baseline = calculateBaseline(responseTimes.slice(0, 5))  // First 5 responses
  const current = calculateRollingAverage(responseTimes.slice(-5))  // Last 5 responses
  const percentageIncrease = ((current - baseline) / baseline) * 100

  if (percentageIncrease > 50) return 100
  if (percentageIncrease > 30) return 75
  if (percentageIncrease > 15) return 50
  if (percentageIncrease > 5) return 25
  return 0
}
```

**Burnout Risk Assessment:**
```typescript
function assessBurnoutRisk(userId: string, timeWindow: number = 14): BurnoutRiskScore {
  const intensity = calculateStudyIntensity(userId, timeWindow)  // Hours/week
  const performanceDecline = calculatePerformanceTrend(userId, timeWindow)  // Percentage drop
  const chronicLoad = countHighLoadDays(userId, timeWindow, threshold=60)  // Days with load >60
  const irregularity = calculateSessionIrregularity(userId, timeWindow)  // Missed sessions
  const engagementDecay = calculateEngagementTrend(userId, timeWindow)  // Motivation decline
  const recoveryDeficit = daysSinceLastLowLoad(userId, threshold=40)  // Days since rest

  const riskScore = (
    (intensity / 40) * 20 +                    // Max 20 points (40hrs = 100%)
    (performanceDecline / 100) * 25 +           // Max 25 points
    (chronicLoad / timeWindow) * 25 +           // Max 25 points (every day high load)
    (irregularity / 10) * 15 +                  // Max 15 points (10 missed sessions)
    (engagementDecay / 100) * 10 +              // Max 10 points
    (recoveryDeficit / 14) * 5                  // Max 5 points (14+ days no rest)
  ) * 100

  const riskLevel =
    riskScore >= 75 ? 'CRITICAL' :
    riskScore >= 50 ? 'HIGH' :
    riskScore >= 25 ? 'MEDIUM' : 'LOW'

  return { riskScore: Math.min(100, riskScore), riskLevel }
}
```

**Automatic Difficulty Adjustment:**
```typescript
function adjustDifficulty(currentLoad: number, sessionContext: SessionContext): DifficultyAdjustment {
  if (currentLoad < 30) {
    // Low load - increase challenge
    return {
      difficultyShift: +1,
      reviewRatio: 0.50,  // 50% review, 50% new
      validationComplexity: 'FULL',
      breakFrequency: 'STANDARD',
      recommendation: 'Increasing challenge - you can handle more'
    }
  } else if (currentLoad >= 30 && currentLoad < 60) {
    // Optimal load - maintain
    return {

**Stress Pattern Identification:**
```typescript
function identifyStressPatterns(userId: string): StressResponsePattern[] {
  const loadHistory = getCognitiveLoadHistory(userId, days=90)
  const patterns: StressResponsePattern[] = []

  // Topic-specific stress
  const topicStress = groupBy(loadHistory, 'topicStudied')
  for (const [topic, sessions] of topicStress) {
    const avgLoad = mean(sessions.map(s => s.loadScore))
    if (avgLoad > 65 && sessions.length >= 3) {
      patterns.push({
        patternType: 'TOPIC_SPECIFIC',
        triggerConditions: { topic },
        responseProfile: { avgLoad, frequency: sessions.length },
        confidence: Math.min(0.95, sessions.length / 10)
      })
    }
  }

  // Time-of-day stress
  const hourStress = groupBy(loadHistory, 'hourOfDay')
  for (const [hour, sessions] of hourStress) {
    const avgLoad = mean(sessions.map(s => s.loadScore))
    if (avgLoad > 60 && sessions.length >= 5) {
      patterns.push({
        patternType: 'TIME_PRESSURE',
        triggerConditions: { hourOfDay: hour },
        responseProfile: { avgLoad, frequency: sessions.length },
        confidence: Math.min(0.90, sessions.length / 15)
      })
    }
  }

  // Exam proximity stress
  const examStress = loadHistory.filter(s => s.daysToExam <= 7)
  if (examStress.length >= 3) {
    const avgLoad = mean(examStress.map(s => s.loadScore))
    if (avgLoad > 70) {
      patterns.push({
        patternType: 'EXAM_PROXIMITY',
        triggerConditions: { daysToExam: '<=7' },
        responseProfile: { avgLoad, frequency: examStress.length },
        confidence: Math.min(0.85, examStress.length / 10)
      })
    }
  }

  return patterns.filter(p => p.confidence >= 0.6)
}
```

### Integration Points

**With Story 5.1 (Learning Pattern Recognition):**
- Uses `BehavioralEvent` model extended with cognitive load markers
- Integrates with `UserLearningProfile` for load tolerance thresholds
- Leverages pattern analysis framework for stress pattern detection

**With Story 5.3 (Session Orchestration):**
- Cognitive load monitoring runs during study sessions
- Session composition adjusted based on load state
- Break recommendations integrated into session flow

**With Story 2.4 (Mission Generation):**
- `MissionGenerator` consumes burnout risk assessment
- Mission complexity and duration adjusted based on cognitive load
- Recovery missions generated when high burnout risk detected

**With Story 4.1-4.6 (Understanding Validation):**
- Validation prompt complexity adjusted based on cognitive load
- Controlled failure scenarios skipped during high load
- Feedback scaffolding increased during overload states

**With Story 2.6 (Mission Analytics):**
- Mission performance correlated with cognitive load during execution
- Adaptation effectiveness measured through load-performance changes
- Insights generated on optimal load zones for mission completion

### Technical Constraints

1. **Real-Time Monitoring:** Cognitive load calculated every 5 minutes during active session. Avoid excessive computation overhead (<100ms per calculation).
2. **Threshold Calibration:** Default thresholds (40/60/80) may need personalization. Collect 4+ weeks data before personalizing thresholds.
3. **Intervention Timing:** Avoid interrupting flow state. Only trigger interventions during natural breaks (between cards, end of section).
4. **Privacy and Stress:** Cognitive load monitoring may induce meta-cognitive stress ("Am I too stressed?"). Provide opt-out in settings.
5. **Statistical Validity:** Correlation analysis requires minimum 30 data points (sessions) for meaningful results. Show "insufficient data" message if below threshold.
6. **Burnout Assessment Frequency:** Run full assessment once per week (Sunday night). Provide on-demand assessment but rate-limit to 1/day.

### Testing Strategy

**Manual Testing (MVP Approach):**
1. **Overload Scenario Testing:**
   - Rapid-fire difficult questions → Verify load score >70
   - Extended session (>90 min) → Confirm duration stress increases
   - Intentional errors (>40% error rate) → Check stress indicators detected
2. **Difficulty Adjustment Testing:**
   - Trigger overload (load >80) → Verify automatic difficulty reduction
   - Confirm content switches to easier cards and review-heavy ratio
   - Check user notification: "High cognitive load detected - adjusting session"
3. **Burnout Prevention Testing:**
   - Simulate 2-week high-intensity period (daily high load) → Verify risk level increases to HIGH/CRITICAL
   - Confirm intervention recommendations appropriate and actionable
   - Test recovery period tracking (load returns to normal after rest)
4. **Dashboard Validation:**
   - Load meter displays real-time load accurately
   - Timeline shows historical trends correctly
   - Burnout risk assessment reflects simulation results
5. **Performance Correlation Testing:**
   - Generate diverse load-performance data (4+ weeks) → Run correlation analysis
   - Verify optimal load zone identification (should be ~40-60 for most users)
   - Check statistical significance reporting (p-value, confidence intervals)

**Edge Cases:**
- User with consistently low load (<30) → No overload prevention needed, focus on challenge increase
- User with chronic high load (>70 for 14+ days) → Critical burnout risk, emergency intervention
- User opts out of cognitive monitoring → Disable load calculation, use default difficulty progression
- Insufficient data (<3 weeks) → Display "Still learning your patterns" message, use conservative thresholds

### UI/UX Considerations

**Design System Compliance:**
- Cognitive load meter uses OKLCH colors: Green oklch(0.7 0.15 145), Yellow oklch(0.8 0.15 90), Orange oklch(0.7 0.15 50), Red oklch(0.6 0.20 30)
- NO gradients - Use solid color zones with transitions
- Glassmorphism for dashboard cards: bg-white/80 backdrop-blur-md
- Timeline chart uses line thickness and opacity to convey load intensity

**Accessibility:**
- Load meter includes text labels and ARIA live region for screen readers
- Color zones supplemented with icons (✓ low, ⚠ moderate, ⚡ high, 🚨 critical)
- Keyboard navigation for intervention recommendation cards
- Dashboard supports high-contrast mode for visual accessibility

**User Messaging:**
- **Supportive, not judgmental:** "You're working hard - let's adjust to support you" (NOT "You're too stressed")
- **Actionable guidance:** "Try 15-minute sessions instead of 60-minute sessions" (specific recommendations)
- **Positive framing:** "Your cognitive load management improved retention by 15%" (celebrate progress)
- **Opt-out transparency:** "Cognitive load monitoring helps prevent burnout. You can disable this in Settings."

**User Flow:**
1. User starts study session (normal load)
2. 30 minutes in, cognitive load increases to 75 (high load detected)
3. System automatically adjusts: Switches to easier cards, reduces validation complexity
4. Notification: "We've detected high cognitive load - adjusting session to support you"
5. Break suggestion appears: "Consider taking a 5-minute break"
6. User takes break (load decreases to 55)
7. Session resumes with adjusted difficulty
8. Session ends - load data recorded for pattern analysis
9. User navigates to `/analytics/cognitive-health` → Sees load timeline, burnout risk assessment
10. System generates weekly insight: "You perform best with 45-minute sessions. Sessions >75 minutes increase load by 40%."

### Performance Optimizations

1. **Incremental Load Calculation:** Calculate load every 5 minutes (not every interaction) to reduce overhead
2. **Caching:** Cache burnout risk assessment for 24 hours (recalculate only once daily unless forced)
3. **Background Analysis:** Stress pattern identification runs as background job (weekly), never blocks user requests
4. **Lazy Loading:** Cognitive load history loaded on-demand when user opens analytics dashboard
5. **Threshold Caching:** Cache personalized load thresholds in UserLearningProfile (avoid recalculation every session)

   - Run cognitive load calculation without automatic adjustments
   - Collect baseline data for threshold personalization
   - Monitor calculation performance in production

2. **Threshold Personalization (Week 4-5):**
   - Analyze collected load data across user base
   - Personalize 40/60/80 thresholds per user learning style
   - Enable automatic difficulty adjustment

3. **Stress Pattern Analysis (Week 5+):**
   - Activate stress pattern detection after 3+ weeks per user
   - Use patterns for personalized intervention timing
   - Generate user-specific load tolerance zones

4. **ML Model Training (Week 8+):**
   - Collect labeled burnout data (user feedback + longitudinal patterns)
   - Train ensemble models on production data
   - Continuously improve with online learning

5. **Monitoring & Alerting:**
   - Alert if calculation time exceeds 150ms (headroom above 100ms target)
