## Story

As a medical student,
I want a comprehensive dashboard consolidating all my understanding validation metrics and insights,
so that I can see the complete picture of my comprehension strengths, weaknesses, and learning progress across all dimensions.

### Technical Implementation Notes

**1. Understanding vs. Memorization Gap Calculation:**
```typescript
interface MemorizationUnderstandingGap {
  objectiveId: string;
  objectiveName: string;
  memorizationScore: number;  // Flashcard performance
  understandingScore: number;  // Validation assessment performance
  gap: number;                 // memorization - understanding
  severity: 'HIGH' | 'MEDIUM' | 'LOW';
  recommendation: string;
}

function calculateGap(objectiveId: string): MemorizationUnderstandingGap {
  const memScore = getAverageFlashcardScore(objectiveId); // 0-100
  const undScore = getAverageValidationScore(objectiveId); // 0-100
  const gap = memScore - undScore;

  let severity: 'HIGH' | 'MEDIUM' | 'LOW';
  if (gap > 30) severity = 'HIGH';
  else if (gap > 20) severity = 'MEDIUM';
  else severity = 'LOW';

  const recommendation = gap > 20
    ? "Illusion of Knowledge detected - increase comprehension prompts and clinical scenarios"
    : "Good alignment between recall and understanding";

  return { objectiveId, memorizationScore: memScore, understandingScore: undScore, gap, severity, recommendation };
}
```

**2. Predictive Model for Exam Success:**
```typescript
interface ExamSuccessPrediction {
  probability: number;  // 0-1
  confidenceInterval: [number, number];
  factors: {
    avgComprehension: number;
    avgReasoning: number;
    masteryCount: number;
    calibrationAccuracy: number;
  };
  recommendation: string;
}

function predictExamSuccess(userId: string, examType: string): ExamSuccessPrediction {
  // Simple logistic regression model
  const features = {
    avgComprehension: getAvgComprehensionScore(userId),
    avgReasoning: getAvgReasoningScore(userId),
    masteryCount: getMasteryCount(userId),
    calibrationAccuracy: getCalibrationCorrelation(userId)
  };

  // Weights learned from historical data (would be ML model in production)
  const weights = { avgComprehension: 0.3, avgReasoning: 0.35, masteryCount: 0.2, calibrationAccuracy: 0.15 };

  const weightedScore = Object.entries(features).reduce(
    (sum, [key, value]) => sum + (value / 100) * weights[key],
    0
  );

  // Logistic function
  const probability = 1 / (1 + Math.exp(-5 * (weightedScore - 0.5)));

  // Simplified confidence interval (would use bootstrap in production)
  const margin = 0.15;
  const confidenceInterval: [number, number] = [
    Math.max(0, probability - margin),
    Math.min(1, probability + margin)
  ];

  const recommendation = probability > 0.7
    ? "Strong likelihood of success - maintain current approach"
    : "Focus on weak areas identified in dashboard to improve success probability";

  return { probability, confidenceInterval, factors, recommendation };
}
```

**3. Forgetting Risk Prediction (Spaced Repetition Model):**
```typescript
function predictForgettingRisk(objectiveId: string, lastReviewDate: Date): {
  probability: number;
  recommendedReviewDate: Date;
  reasoning: string;
} {
  const daysSinceReview = (Date.now() - lastReviewDate.getTime()) / (1000 * 60 * 60 * 24);
  const initialScore = getInitialScore(objectiveId);
  const reviewCount = getReviewCount(objectiveId);
  const difficulty = getDifficulty(objectiveId);

  // Ebbinghaus forgetting curve with adjustments
  // R = e^(-t/S) where R = retention, t = time, S = strength
  const strength = initialScore * Math.log(reviewCount + 1) / (difficulty / 50);
  const retention = Math.exp(-daysSinceReview / strength);
  const forgettingProbability = 1 - retention;

  // Recommend review when retention drops below 80%
  const targetRetention = 0.8;
  const daysToTarget = -strength * Math.log(targetRetention);
  const recommendedDate = new Date(lastReviewDate.getTime() + daysToTarget * 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000);

  const reasoning = forgettingProbability > 0.3
    ? "High forgetting risk - review soon to maintain mastery"
    : "Retention strong - review scheduled for optimal timing";

  return { probability: forgettingProbability, recommendedReviewDate: recommendedDate, reasoning };
}
```

    max_tokens: 1500
  });

  // Parse response into structured insights
  return parseInsights(response.choices[0].message.content);
}
```

**5. Cross-Objective Correlation Matrix:**
```typescript
function calculateCorrelationMatrix(userId: string): number[][] {
  const objectives = getAllObjectives();
  const scores: Record<string, number[]> = {};

  // Gather all validation scores for each objective
  objectives.forEach(obj => {
    scores[obj.id] = getValidationScores(userId, obj.id);
  });

  // Calculate pairwise Pearson correlations
  const matrix: number[][] = [];
  for (let i = 0; i < objectives.length; i++) {
    matrix[i] = [];
    for (let j = 0; j < objectives.length; j++) {
      if (i === j) {
        matrix[i][j] = 1.0; // Perfect correlation with self
      } else {
        matrix[i][j] = pearsonCorrelation(scores[objectives[i].id], scores[objectives[j].id]);
      }
    }
  }

  return matrix;
}

function pearsonCorrelation(x: number[], y: number[]): number {
  const n = Math.min(x.length, y.length);
  if (n < 3) return 0; // Insufficient data

  const sumX = x.slice(0, n).reduce((a, b) => a + b, 0);
  const sumY = y.slice(0, n).reduce((a, b) => a + b, 0);
  const sumXY = x.slice(0, n).reduce((sum, xi, i) => sum + xi * y[i], 0);
  const sumX2 = x.slice(0, n).reduce((sum, xi) => sum + xi * xi, 0);
  const sumY2 = y.slice(0, n).reduce((sum, yi) => sum + yi * yi, 0);

  const numerator = n * sumXY - sumX * sumY;
  const denominator = Math.sqrt((n * sumX2 - sumX * sumX) * (n * sumY2 - sumY * sumY));

  return denominator === 0 ? 0 : numerator / denominator;
}
```

**6. Peer Benchmarking Privacy:**
- Explicit opt-in required (default: opt-out)
- Minimum cohort size: 50 users (prevent identification)
- Only aggregated statistics shared (no individual data)
- Anonymized: No names, emails, or demographics
- User can opt-out anytime (removes from future aggregations)
- Clear privacy notice: "Your data helps peers anonymously; you remain unidentifiable"

**7. Performance Optimization Strategy:**
```typescript
// Nightly aggregation cron job
async function aggregateUnderstandingMetrics() {
  const users = await prisma.user.findMany({ where: { active: true } });

  for (const user of users) {
    // Pre-calculate all dashboard metrics
    const dashboard = {
      comprehension: await calculateComprehensionMetrics(user.id),
      reasoning: await calculateReasoningMetrics(user.id),
      calibration: await calculateCalibrationMetrics(user.id),
      adaptive: await calculateAdaptiveMetrics(user.id),
      mastery: await calculateMasteryMetrics(user.id)
    };

    // Store in Redis cache with 24-hour TTL
    await redis.set(`understanding:dashboard:${user.id}`, JSON.stringify(dashboard), 'EX', 86400);
  }

  // Also aggregate peer benchmarks
  await aggregatePeerBenchmarks();
}

// API endpoint uses cached data
async function getUnderstandingDashboard(userId: string) {
  // Try cache first
  const cached = await redis.get(`understanding:dashboard:${userId}`);
  if (cached) return JSON.parse(cached);

  // Fallback to real-time calculation (slower)
  return await calculateDashboardRealtime(userId);
}
```
