### Database Schema Extensions

**Extend `LearningObjective` model:**
```prisma
model LearningObjective {
  // ... existing fields ...

  // Performance tracking fields (NEW)
  masteryLevel      MasteryLevel  @default(NOT_STARTED)
  totalStudyTimeMs  Int           @default(0)
  lastStudiedAt     DateTime?
  weaknessScore     Float         @default(0.5) // 0.0-1.0, higher = weaker

  // Relations
  performanceMetrics PerformanceMetric[]
}

enum MasteryLevel {
  NOT_STARTED
  BEGINNER
  INTERMEDIATE
  ADVANCED
  MASTERED
}
```

**Create `PerformanceMetric` model:**
```prisma
model PerformanceMetric {
  id                   String              @id @default(cuid())
  userId               String
  learningObjectiveId  String
  date                 DateTime            @default(now())
  retentionScore       Float               // 0.0-1.0 from FSRS
  studyTimeMs          Int                 // Time spent on this objective today
  reviewCount          Int                 // Number of reviews today
  correctReviews       Int
  incorrectReviews     Int
  createdAt            DateTime            @default(now())

  // Relations
  learningObjective    LearningObjective   @relation(fields: [learningObjectiveId], references: [id], onDelete: Cascade)

  @@unique([userId, learningObjectiveId, date])
  @@index([userId, date])
  @@index([learningObjectiveId])
  @@map("performance_metrics")
}
```

### Key Algorithms

**Weakness Score Calculation:**
```
weaknessScore = (retentionFactor * 0.4) + (studyTimeFactor * 0.3) + (failureFactor * 0.2) + (confidenceFactor * 0.1)

Where:
- retentionFactor = 1.0 - avgRetentionScore (inverted, so low retention = high factor)
- studyTimeFactor = min(1.0, totalStudyTimeMs / avgStudyTimeForMasteryMs) (high study time with low mastery = high factor)
- failureFactor = incorrectReviews / totalReviews (high failure rate = high factor)
- confidenceFactor = 1.0 - (userConfidence / 5.0) (low confidence = high factor)
```

**Mastery Level Thresholds:**
```
NOT_STARTED: No reviews completed
BEGINNER: retentionScore < 0.5 OR reviewCount < 3
INTERMEDIATE: retentionScore 0.5-0.7 AND reviewCount >= 3
ADVANCED: retentionScore 0.7-0.9 AND reviewCount >= 5
MASTERED: retentionScore >= 0.9 AND reviewCount >= 10
```

### Integration Points

**With Story 2.1 (Learning Objective Extraction):**
- Uses `LearningObjective` model created in Story 2.1
- Performance metrics track mastery of extracted objectives
- Weakness identification helps prioritize which objectives need re-extraction/clarification

**With Story 1.6 (Study Session Management):**
- Study sessions generate performance data
- `StudySession.durationMs` contributes to `totalStudyTimeMs` per objective
- Session completion triggers performance metric calculation

**With Story 2.3 (Intelligent Prioritization - Future):**
- Weakness scores will feed into prioritization algorithm
- Weak areas automatically elevated in mission generation
- Performance trends inform long-term study planning

**With FSRS Scheduler (Story 1.5):**
- FSRS retrievability data populates `retentionScore`
- Review outcomes update performance metrics
- Weakness scores modulate FSRS scheduling intervals

### Technical Constraints

1. **Performance Calculation Frequency:** Batch job runs daily at midnight OR on-demand via API trigger. Real-time updates too expensive for MVP.
2. **Data Retention:** Performance metrics retained indefinitely unless user requests deletion. Historical data enables trend analysis.
3. **Privacy:** All performance data tied to `userId`, never shared externally. FERPA compliant.
4. **Charting Library:** Use Recharts (already in dependencies from UX spec). Supports time-series, bar charts, trend lines.
5. **Database Indexes:** Critical for performance with 1000+ objectives. Add indexes in migration.
6. **Auth Deferral:** Performance APIs hardcoded to kevy@americano.dev for MVP. Add auth in production.

### Testing Strategy

**Unit Tests (Deferred to Production):**
- Test `PerformanceCalculator` methods with known inputs
- Validate weakness score formula accuracy
- Test mastery level transitions

**Manual Testing (MVP Approach):**
1. Create 20+ learning objectives with Story 2.1
2. Complete study sessions and reviews (Story 1.6)
3. Trigger performance calculation batch job
4. Verify weakness identification accuracy
5. Test progress page with real data
6. Validate charts render correctly across devices

**Edge Cases to Test:**
- Objective with no reviews (should show NOT_STARTED)
- Objective with perfect reviews (should show MASTERED)
- Objective with high study time but low retention (should have high weakness score)
- User opts out of performance tracking (APIs return empty results)

### UI/UX Considerations

**Design System Compliance:**
- All charts and components use glassmorphism (bg-white/80 backdrop-blur-md)
- OKLCH colors for data visualization (NO gradients)
- Inter font for body text, DM Sans for headings
- Min 44px touch targets for all interactive elements
- Responsive breakpoints: 1200px+ (desktop), 768-1199px (tablet), <768px (mobile)

**Accessibility:**
- Charts include ARIA labels and screen reader descriptions
- Color-blind friendly palette for performance indicators
- Keyboard navigation for all interactive components
- Focus states on buttons and links

**User Flow:**
1. User completes study session → Performance metrics calculated
2. User navigates to `/progress` page
3. Dashboard shows mastery distribution, weak areas, trends
4. User clicks on weak area → Drill into objective details
5. User can input confidence rating → Blends with algorithmic score
6. User clicks "Focus on Weaknesses" → Mission generated with weak objectives

### Performance Optimizations

1. **Aggregate Fields on `LearningObjective`:** Avoid recalculating on every API call. Update via batch job.
2. **Database Indexes:** Speed up weakness queries (`WHERE weaknessScore > 0.6 ORDER BY weaknessScore DESC`)
3. **Caching:** Cache performance summary data for 1 hour (can use React Query or SWR in future)
4. **Pagination:** Weak areas API returns top 10 by default. Paginate if >100 objectives.

5. Test PerformanceTrendChart renders correctly across time ranges (7d/30d/90d/all)
6. Validate mastery level transitions (NOT_STARTED → BEGINNER → INTERMEDIATE → ADVANCED → MASTERED)
7. Test privacy controls: toggle tracking OFF, reset data with confirmation, export JSON
8. Test integration with MissionGenerator: weak objectives (weaknessScore > 0.6) appear more frequently in missions

**Edge Cases Identified:**
- Objective with no reviews → should show NOT_STARTED mastery level ✅
- Objective with perfect reviews → should show MASTERED if >= 10 reviews and retention >= 0.9 ✅
- Objective with high study time but low retention → should have high weakness score ✅
- User opts out of performance tracking → APIs respect performanceTrackingEnabled preference ✅

**Unit/E2E Tests (Deferred to Production):**
- PerformanceCalculator.calculateWeaknessScore() with known inputs
- Mastery level transition logic validation
- Weakness score formula accuracy tests
- Integration testing: study session completion → performance metric update → API response

### Architectural Alignment

**Architecture Compliance:** ✅ **100%**

- **Next.js 15 Patterns:** ✅ All API routes use async params, proper Response.json() wrapping
- **Zod Validation:** ✅ All endpoints validate request/response schemas
- **Error Handling:** ✅ Consistent errorResponse/successResponse pattern
- **Database:** ✅ Prisma client singleton, proper indexes (weaknessScore, masteryLevel, userId+date)
- **Design System:** ✅ Glassmorphism (bg-white/80 backdrop-blur-md), OKLCH colors, NO gradients
- **Responsive:** ✅ Mobile-first layouts, min 44px touch targets
- **Typography:** ✅ Inter (body) + DM Sans (headings)

**Integration Points:**
- Story 2.1 (Learning Objective Extraction): ✅ Uses LearningObjective model created in Story 2.1
- Story 1.6 (Study Session Management): ✅ Study sessions generate performance data via durationMs
- Story 2.4 (Mission Generation): ✅ MissionGenerator integrated with weakness score for prioritization
- FSRS Scheduler (Story 1.5): ✅ FSRS retrievability data populates retentionScore

### Security Notes

**Security Assessment:** ✅ **Good for MVP**

**Strengths:**
- Input validation via Zod schemas (query params, request bodies)
- Prisma ORM prevents SQL injection
- Proper error handling (no stack trace leakage in production)
- FERPA compliance: user owns performance data, full export/deletion capabilities
- Privacy-first: performanceTrackingEnabled toggle prevents unwanted tracking

**Auth/Rate Limiting (Appropriately Deferred):**
- Authentication: Hardcoded kevy@americano.dev for MVP (single user local development)
- Rate limiting: Deferred (no abuse risk for single-user MVP)
- Migration path documented: Add Clerk/Auth.js when deploying to production

**Pre-Production Requirements:**
1. Replace hardcoded user ID with proper authentication
2. Implement rate limiting (Upstash Rate Limit or Vercel Edge Config)
3. Add request logging and monitoring (Sentry)
4. Enable CORS restrictions for API endpoints

### Best-Practices and References

**Framework Best Practices:**
- ✅ Next.js 15 (verified via context7 MCP):
  - Async params in API routes
  - Response.json() for all API responses
  - Server components for static content
  - Client components for interactive features ('use client')
- ✅ Zod 4: Latest schema validation patterns
- ✅ React 19: Proper hooks usage (useState, useEffect, useRouter)
- ✅ TypeScript 5.9: Strict typing, no any types (except controlled Prisma responses)

**Performance Optimizations:**
1. **Aggregate fields on LearningObjective:** Avoid recalculating on every API call (weaknessScore, masteryLevel cached)
2. **Database indexes:** Speed up weakness queries (`WHERE weaknessScore > 0.6 ORDER BY weaknessScore DESC`)
3. **Time-series model:** PerformanceMetric enables efficient trend queries without scanning Review table
4. **Batch updates:** Daily batch job (updateAllPerformanceMetrics) instead of real-time per-review calculation

**Data Quality:**
- **Gemini Embedding Dimension:** 1536 (verified correct, within pgvector 0.8.1 limits)
- **FSRS Stability Normalization:** `Math.min(1.0, review.stabilityAfter / 10)` for 0-1 range
- **Mastery Thresholds:** Match Story 2.2 specification exactly
- **Weakness Formula:** Weights sum to 1.0 (0.4 + 0.3 + 0.2 + 0.1 = 1.0)

**References:**
- Next.js 15 Docs (context7 MCP): Async params, API routes patterns
- Recharts Docs: Time-series chart, moving average calculations
- Zod 4 Docs: Coercion patterns (z.coerce.number())
- FERPA Compliance: User data ownership, export/deletion capabilities

### Key Findings

#### High Priority

✅ **NONE IDENTIFIED**

#### Medium Priority

1. **[Code Quality] Extract magic numbers to constants** (Estimated: 30 min)
   - **File:** `apps/web/src/lib/performance-calculator.ts:14-33, :312-322`
   - **Issue:** Magic numbers embedded in code reduce maintainability
   - **Recommendation:** Extract thresholds to constants at top of file or config:
     ```typescript
     const MASTERY_THRESHOLDS = { /* already done! ✅ */ };
     const TIME_FOR_MASTERY_BASE_MINUTES = { BASIC: 20, INTERMEDIATE: 40, ADVANCED: 60 };
     ```
   - **Impact:** Low risk, improves readability and future adjustments

2. **[Code Quality] Add JSDoc documentation to PerformanceCalculator methods** (Estimated: 1 hour)
   - **File:** `apps/web/src/lib/performance-calculator.ts:40-323`
   - **Issue:** Public methods lack JSDoc comments explaining parameters and return values
   - **Recommendation:** Add JSDoc for calculateRetentionScore, calculateWeaknessScore, calculateMasteryLevel, identifyWeakAreas
   - **Impact:** Low risk, improves developer experience and maintainability

3. **[Code Quality] Enhance error messages with context** (Estimated: 30 min)
   - **File:** `apps/web/src/app/api/performance/weak-areas/route.ts:66`, `mastery-summary/route.ts:90`
   - **Issue:** Generic error messages don't provide debugging context
   - **Recommendation:** Include request details (userId, query params) in error logs (not user-facing message)
   - **Impact:** Low risk, improves debugging in production

#### Low Priority

1. **[Performance] Extract time-of-day calculation utility** (Estimated: 20 min)
   - **File:** `apps/web/src/components/progress/performance-trend-chart.tsx:88-108`
   - **Issue:** Moving average calculation could be reused across components
   - **Recommendation:** Extract to `@/lib/chart-utils.ts` if needed elsewhere
   - **Impact:** Negligible, minor code reuse improvement

2. **[Code Quality] Remove rate limiting comments** (Estimated: 5 min)
   - **File:** `apps/web/src/app/api/performance/*/route.ts` (multiple files)
   - **Issue:** Comments about deferred rate limiting clutter production code
   - **Recommendation:** Move to docs/PRODUCTION-CHECKLIST.md or remove
   - **Impact:** Negligible, code cleanliness

3. **[Code Quality] Zod coercion pattern already correct** (Estimated: 0 min)
   - **File:** `apps/web/src/app/api/performance/weak-areas/route.ts:15`
   - **Issue:** None - using z.coerce.number() correctly for query param parsing
   - **Status:** ✅ Already following best practices
