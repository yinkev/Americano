## Dev Notes

### Architecture Context

**Subsystem:** Knowledge Graph & Semantic Search (Subsystem 3)
- Primary implementation in: `apps/web/src/subsystems/knowledge-graph/`
- API routes: `apps/web/src/app/api/conflicts/`
- UI components: `apps/web/src/components/conflicts/`

**Technology Stack:**
- **Conflict Detection:** Semantic analysis using vector embeddings (Gemini), GPT-5 for complex analysis
- **Database:** PostgreSQL with Prisma ORM, new `Conflict` and `Source` models
- **Frontend:** React, shadcn/ui components, motion.dev for animations
- **Evidence-Based Medicine:** Integration with medical guideline databases

**Source:** [solution-architecture.md#Subsystem 3, lines 551-575; Epic 3 story details]

### Integration Points

**Existing Infrastructure to Leverage:**
1. **Semantic Search Engine** (Story 3.1)
   - Location: `apps/web/src/subsystems/knowledge-graph/semantic-search.ts`
   - Reuse vector similarity infrastructure for conflict detection
   - Cosine similarity calculations already implemented

2. **Knowledge Graph** (Story 3.2)
   - Location: `apps/web/src/subsystems/knowledge-graph/graph-builder.ts`
   - Concept relationships inform conflict context
   - Cross-reference conflicts with concept hierarchy

3. **First Aid Integration** (Story 3.3)
   - First Aid content provides authoritative baseline for conflict detection
   - Lecture content compared against First Aid for discrepancies
   - First Aid credibility score used as gold standard (95/100)

4. **Content Processing Pipeline** (Story 1.2)
   - Location: `apps/web/src/subsystems/content-processing/`
   - Extend to run conflict detection after embedding generation
   - Update processing status to include conflict scanning

**Source:** [solution-architecture.md#Subsystem Integration, lines 673-695; Epic 3 prerequisites]

### Performance Considerations

**Conflict Detection Efficiency:**
- Avoid N×N comparisons: Use vector similarity pre-filtering (cosine similarity > 0.85) to narrow candidates
- Batch processing: Scan conflicts in background jobs, not real-time during study sessions
- Incremental updates: Only scan new content for conflicts, not entire database each time
- Caching: Cache conflict detection results, invalidate when sources update

**Database Optimization:**
- Index conflict table: `conceptId`, `status`, `severity` for fast filtering
- Partial indexes: Only index active conflicts for better query performance
- Denormalization: Store conflict summaries in Conflict table to avoid joins
- Query limits: Paginate conflict lists, don't load all conflicts at once

**Target Performance:**
- Conflict detection: <500ms per concept (background job, not user-facing)
- Conflict list retrieval: <200ms for dashboard widget
- Conflict detail modal: <300ms to load comparison view
- Batch scanning: Process 100 concepts in <5 minutes (background job)

**Source:** [solution-architecture.md#Database Indexes, lines 1137-1154; NFR1 performance requirements]

### Medical Content Specificity

**Common Medical Conflicts:**
1. **Dosage Variations:** Different sources may recommend different medication doses
   - Example: "Aspirin 81mg daily" vs "Aspirin 162mg loading dose"
   - Context matters: Prophylaxis vs. acute treatment

2. **Contraindications:** Sources may disagree on contraindications
   - Example: One source lists pregnancy as absolute contraindication, another as relative
   - Resolution: Check official FDA guidelines and latest evidence

3. **Mechanism Explanations:** Simplified vs. detailed mechanism descriptions
   - Example: Lecture oversimplifies, textbook provides complete pathway
   - Not always true conflict: May be different levels of detail

4. **Treatment Protocols:** Guidelines evolve, sources may reflect different time periods
   - Example: ACLS protocol changes, old lectures vs. current guidelines
   - Resolution: Prefer most recent official guidelines

5. **Statistical Claims:** Different studies may report different outcomes
   - Example: "30% mortality" vs "40% mortality" for same condition
   - Resolution: Check meta-analyses, consider study populations and dates

**Conflict Detection Challenges:**
- Medical terminology variations: "MI" vs "myocardial infarction" vs "heart attack"
- Context-dependent statements: Treatment varies by patient population
- Updates vs. contradictions: Distinguish evolving knowledge from true conflicts
- Nuanced differences: "May cause" vs "commonly causes" vs "rarely causes"

**Mitigation Strategies:**
- Normalize medical terms before comparison
- Consider temporal context (publication dates)
- Use GPT-5 to assess if differences are substantive vs. stylistic
- Provide clear explanations of conflict nature to users

### User Experience Notes

**Conflict Notification Strategy:**
- Non-intrusive: Don't interrupt study flow with conflict alerts
- Dashboard prominence: Surface high-severity conflicts in dashboard widget
- Contextual display: Show conflict indicators when viewing relevant content
- User control: Allow users to dismiss low-priority conflicts
- Educational approach: Frame conflicts as learning opportunities, not errors

**Conflict Resolution Guidance:**
- Clear recommendations: Provide actionable guidance, not just "sources disagree"
- Explain reasoning: Show why one source is recommended over another
- Encourage critical thinking: Help users evaluate evidence, not just defer to authority
- Transparent credibility: Display source rankings openly, allow user customization
- Update notifications: Alert users when conflicts are resolved or sources change

**Error Handling:**
- AI analysis failures: Fall back to simple difference highlighting if GPT-5 unavailable
- Missing source metadata: Display conflicts even if credibility data incomplete
- Unresolvable conflicts: Clearly indicate when expert review is needed
- User feedback: Provide easy way to report false conflicts or incorrect resolutions

**Source:** [ux-specification.md#Conflict handling, UX design principles]

### Security and Privacy

**Data Privacy:**
- User-flagged conflicts are private by default (unless shared with community)
- No external sharing of conflict data or user resolution preferences
- User source preferences stored securely, not shared with other users

**Content Integrity:**
- Prevent malicious conflict flagging: Rate limiting, spam detection
- Source verification: Ensure only trusted sources added to credibility database
- Conflict audit trail: Immutable history of conflict changes for accountability
- User permissions: Only allow users to manage conflicts in their own content

**Source:** [NFR3 Security & Privacy, PRD; solution-architecture.md#Security]

### Testing Strategy

**Unit Tests:**
- `ConflictDetector`: Mock vector similarity, test contradiction detection logic
- `EBMEvaluator`: Test evidence level assignments and source scoring
- API routes: Test conflict detection, flagging, resolution endpoints

**Integration Tests:**
- End-to-end conflict workflow: Upload conflicting sources → Detect → Display → Resolve
- Source credibility integration: Verify credibility rankings affect recommendations
- Historical tracking: Validate complete audit trail of conflict lifecycle

**Manual Testing:**
- Medical accuracy: Review sample conflicts with medical expert to validate detection
- UI/UX: Test conflict visualization and resolution flow on desktop and mobile
- Performance: Measure conflict detection time with real medical content

**Test Data:**
- Create sample conflicting content: Lectures with different dosage recommendations
- First Aid vs. Lecture conflicts: Test lecture content against First Aid standard
- Multi-source conflicts: Test >2 sources conflicting on same topic

**No automated tests required for MVP** (per solution-architecture.md #Section 2, line 386)

- Story 3.3: First Aid Integration (cross-referencing, authoritative source baseline)

### Known Issues / Risks

**Risk 1: Conflict Detection Accuracy**
- Challenge: Distinguishing true conflicts from different levels of detail or context
- Example: "Aspirin 81mg" (prophylaxis) vs "Aspirin 325mg" (acute MI) aren't really conflicting
- Mitigation: Use GPT-5 to assess context and substantive vs. stylistic differences
- Target: >85% true positive rate, <10% false positive rate

**Risk 2: Source Credibility Subjectivity**
- Challenge: Assigning credibility scores is somewhat subjective
- Example: Is a recent lecture more credible than older First Aid edition?
- Mitigation: Use transparent, evidence-based criteria; allow user customization
- Decision: Prefer official guidelines > peer-reviewed literature > First Aid > lectures

**Risk 3: Conflict Overload**
- Challenge: Too many low-severity conflicts may overwhelm users
- Example: Minor wording differences flagged as conflicts
- Mitigation: Severity filtering, default to showing only MEDIUM+ conflicts
- User control: Allow users to adjust sensitivity in settings

**Risk 4: Performance at Scale**
- Challenge: Conflict detection across large knowledge base may be slow
- Example: Scanning 10,000 content chunks for conflicts could take minutes
- Mitigation: Background job processing, incremental scanning, caching
- Performance target: <500ms per concept for background jobs

**Risk 5: Medical Accuracy Liability**
- Challenge: System may incorrectly recommend less authoritative source
- Legal consideration: Disclaimer that platform is educational tool, not medical advice
- Mitigation: Display all conflicting sources, allow user to make final decision
- Evidence-based approach: Show reasoning and evidence levels transparently

**Decision Required:**
- Automatic conflict resolution vs. always require user decision?
- Recommendation: Auto-suggest but never auto-resolve; user always confirms

### Key Technical Notes to Include

**Conflict Detection Algorithm:**
- Semantic analysis: Use vector embeddings to find topically similar chunks (cosine similarity > 0.85)
- Contradiction detection: NLP analysis for negation patterns, contradictory terms
- Medical context: Understand nuanced differences (dosage, indications, contraindications)
- Confidence scoring: Rate certainty of conflict detection (0.0-1.0)
- False positive reduction: Filter out stylistic differences and context-dependent variations

**Source Credibility Database:**
- Medical education rankings: First Aid (95), journals (90), guidelines (95), lectures (70-85), user notes (50)
- Evidence-based medicine hierarchy: Systematic reviews > RCTs > cohort studies > case studies > expert opinion
- Dynamic updates: Track source content changes, update credibility when evidence evolves
- User customization: Allow personal source preference overrides

**User Interface for Conflict Visualization:**
- Visual indicators: Warning badges with severity color coding (yellow, orange, red)
- Side-by-side comparison: Show conflicting content with highlighted differences
- Source attribution: Display credibility scores, EBM levels, publication dates
- Resolution suggestions: AI-powered recommendations with reasoning
- User actions: Flag, dismiss, resolve, add notes, mark for expert review

**Community Flagging System:**
- User-generated conflict reports: Allow users to flag potential conflicts
- Review queue: Store flagged conflicts for community or expert review
- Validation workflow: Verify user-flagged conflicts before marking as confirmed
- Spam prevention: Rate limiting, user reputation scoring (future)

**Evidence-Based Medicine Integration:**
- EBM pyramid: Map sources to evidence levels (systematic review, RCT, cohort, case study, opinion)
- Clinical guidelines: Integrate official medical guidelines as authoritative sources
- Evidence citations: Link conflicts to PubMed articles, Cochrane reviews
- Educational content: Explain EBM principles to help users make informed decisions

**Historical Tracking:**
- Conflict lifecycle: Track detection → resolution → updates → changes
- Audit trail: Immutable history of all conflict status changes
- Version control: Store content snapshots at time of conflict detection
- Evolution tracking: Monitor when conflicts are resolved by source updates
- Timeline visualization: Show conflict history chronologically
