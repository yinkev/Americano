# Story 1.6 - Bug Fixes Session

**Date:** 2025-10-15
**Agent:** Amelia (DEV) / Claude Sonnet 4.5
**Session Type:** Bug fixes and production readiness

## Session Summary

This session focused on fixing critical bugs discovered during user testing of Story 1.6 (Basic Study Session Management). All bugs were identified and fixed, bringing the story to production-ready status.

## Bugs Fixed

### Bug #1: Database User Lookup Error (400 Bad Request)

**Issue:**
- Clicking "Start Session" resulted in 400 Bad Request error
- Console showed: `Foreign key constraint violated on the constraint: study_sessions_userId_fkey`
- Root cause: API routes hardcoded `userId = 'user-1'` but database users have different IDs

**Fix:**
- Changed all API routes to look up user by email: `kevy@americano.dev`
- Pattern: `const user = await prisma.user.findUnique({ where: { email } })`
- Files modified:
  - `src/app/api/learning/sessions/route.ts` (POST & GET)
  - `src/app/api/analytics/study-time/route.ts`
  - `src/app/api/analytics/time-per-topic/route.ts`

**Result:** ✅ Sessions now create successfully

---

### Bug #2: User Switching Not Supported

**Issue:**
- All API routes hardcoded to `kevy@americano.dev`
- Switching to Dumpling user in sidebar had no effect
- Sessions always saved to Kevy's account

**Fix:**
1. Created global user store: `src/store/use-user-store.ts`
   - Zustand store with localStorage persistence
   - Tracks currently selected user email
   - Synced with sidebar dropdown

2. Updated sidebar to use global store:
   - `src/components/app-sidebar.tsx`
   - User selection now persists across page reloads

3. Updated study page to send user email in headers:
   - `src/app/study/page.tsx`
   - All API requests include `X-User-Email` header

4. Updated all API routes to read from header:
   - Pattern: `const userEmail = request.headers.get('X-User-Email') || 'kevy@americano.dev'`
   - Fallback to Kevy if header missing (backwards compatibility)

**Result:** ✅ User switching works - sessions save to correct user account

---

### Bug #3: Timer Continued Running After User Switch

**Issue:**
- Start timer as Kevy → switch to Dumpling → timer still running
- Dumpling saw Kevy's active session
- Session state not isolated per user

**Fix:**
1. Added `userEmail` field to session store:
   - `src/store/use-session-store.ts`
   - Tracks which user owns the active session

2. Implemented user mismatch detection:
   - `src/app/study/page.tsx` - `useEffect` hook
   - Compares current user vs session owner
   - Auto-clears session if mismatch detected

**Result:** ✅ Each user has isolated timer state

---

### Bug #4: Session Abandoned on User Switch (Data Loss)

**Issue:**
- Switching users cleared active session without saving
- Study time lost
- Session left orphaned in database

**Fix:**
- Implemented auto-complete logic in `useEffect`:
  ```typescript
  if (sessionId && sessionUserEmail && sessionUserEmail !== userEmail) {
    // Calculate duration
    const pausedDurationMs = getPausedDuration();

    // Complete session for previous user
    await fetch(`/api/learning/sessions/${sessionId}/complete`, {
      headers: { 'X-User-Email': sessionUserEmail }
    });

    // Clear UI
    clearSession();
  }
  ```
- Session saved with accurate duration before clearing
- Uses previous user's email to save to correct account

**Result:** ✅ No data loss when switching users - sessions auto-save

---

### Bug #5: React State Update Error

**Issue:**
```
Cannot update a component (SessionTimer) while rendering a different component (StudyPage)
```
- Calling `clearSession()` during render caused error
- React doesn't allow state updates during render phase

**Fix:**
- Moved user-mismatch check to `useEffect` hook
- State updates now happen after render completes
- Proper dependency array: `[userEmail, sessionId, sessionUserEmail, clearSession]`

**Result:** ✅ Clean user switching without React errors

---

## Files Created

1. `src/store/use-user-store.ts` - Global user context management

## Files Modified

1. `src/app/api/learning/sessions/route.ts` - User header support
2. `src/app/api/analytics/study-time/route.ts` - User header support
3. `src/app/api/analytics/time-per-topic/route.ts` - User header support
4. `src/store/use-session-store.ts` - User-aware session isolation
5. `src/components/app-sidebar.tsx` - Global user store integration
6. `src/app/study/page.tsx` - User switching + auto-complete logic
7. `docs/stories/story-1.6.md` - Bug fix documentation

## Testing Performed

### Manual Testing:
1. ✅ Start session as Kevy → saves to Kevy's account
2. ✅ Switch to Dumpling → Kevy's session auto-completes
3. ✅ Start session as Dumpling → saves to Dumpling's account
4. ✅ Refresh page → session persists for current user
5. ✅ Timer displays 00:00:00 after user switch
6. ✅ No React errors in console
7. ✅ Toast notifications show correct messages

### API Testing:
1. ✅ POST `/api/learning/sessions` with `X-User-Email` header
2. ✅ GET `/api/learning/sessions` with `X-User-Email` header
3. ✅ PATCH `/api/learning/sessions/[id]/complete` with different user email
4. ✅ GET `/api/analytics/study-time` with `X-User-Email` header

## Production Readiness

**Status:** ✅ Ready for Review

All critical bugs fixed:
- ✅ Database constraints satisfied
- ✅ User switching fully functional
- ✅ Session isolation per user
- ✅ No data loss on user switch
- ✅ Zero React errors
- ✅ TypeScript compilation clean

## Remaining Work

**Deferred to Story 1.6.1:**
- Task 7: Study history page UI
- Task 9: Analytics dashboard with charts
- Task 12: Session notifications

**Documentation:**
- Wireframes already created: `docs/wireframes-study-session-ui.md`
- Implementation estimates: Task 7 (1.5h), Task 9 (2h), Task 12 (1h)

## Recommendations

1. **Approve Story 1.6** - Core functionality complete and bug-free
2. **Create Story 1.6.1** - Focus on UI polish (history page, charts, notifications)
3. **Begin Epic 2** - Personal Learning GPS stories
4. **User acceptance testing** - Test `/study` page with both Kevy and Dumpling users
