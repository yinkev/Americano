### Key Components and Features

**Dashboard Structure:**
1. **Patterns Tab:** Visualization of detected learning patterns, evolution timeline, comparison tools
2. **Progress Tab:** Behavioral metrics, academic performance correlation, milestone achievements
3. **Goals Tab:** Active goals, goal creation, completed goals archive
4. **Learn Tab:** Learning science education, personalized explanations, resource library

**Core Features:**
1. **Pattern Visualization:** Heatmaps, charts, confidence indicators, pattern evolution
2. **Recommendations Engine:** AI-generated suggestions with impact estimates and application tracking
3. **Goal System:** Template-based and custom goals with automated progress tracking
4. **Learning Science Education:** Personalized articles explaining why behavioral insights matter
5. **Performance Correlation:** Statistical analysis showing behavioral improvements predict academic success
6. **Notification System:** Timely alerts for new insights, goal progress, achievements

### Integration Points

**With Story 5.1 (Learning Pattern Recognition):**
- Uses BehavioralPattern, UserLearningProfile, and BehavioralInsight models
- Displays patterns detected by Story 5.1 analyzers
- Shows study time heatmaps, learning style profiles, forgetting curves

**With Story 2.6 (Mission Analytics):**
- Correlates mission completion with mastery improvement
- Shows mission impact on academic performance
- Uses mission analytics for goal progress tracking

**With Story 2.4 (Mission Generation):**
- Recommendations can update mission generation preferences
- Applied insights influence future mission scheduling
- Goal achievements trigger mission adjustments

**With Story 1.6 (Study Session Management):**
- Session performance data feeds behavioral metrics
- Study consistency tracked from session history

**With Story 4.6 (Understanding Analytics):**
- Comprehension metrics integrated into behavioral score
- Validation performance correlates with retention insights

### Educational Content Strategy

**Learning Science Articles (5 core articles):**
1. **Spaced Repetition Science:** Explains Ebbinghaus curve, personal forgetting curve comparison
2. **Active Recall Benefits:** Retrieval practice research, validation prompt effectiveness
3. **VARK Learning Styles:** User's profile, how to leverage each dimension, research nuance
4. **Cognitive Load Theory:** Intrinsic vs. extrinsic load, session orchestration strategies
5. **Circadian Rhythms:** Time-of-day performance, optimal study windows, energy patterns

**External Resources:**
- Books: "Make It Stick" (Brown et al.), "Learning How to Learn" (Oakley & Sejnowski)
- Videos: Coursera "Learning How to Learn", YouTube learning science channels
- Papers: Key research studies with open access links

**Personalization:**
- Each article includes "Your Data" section with user's specific patterns
- Recommendations based on user's current challenges
- Interactive visualizations with user's real data

### UX/UI Design Considerations

**Design System Compliance:**
- Glassmorphism: `bg-white/80 backdrop-blur-md` for all cards
- OKLCH colors: NO gradients, use perceptually uniform OKLCH color space
- Charts: Recharts library with OKLCH color palette
- Icons: Lucide React (consistent with rest of app)
- Responsive: Desktop (full dashboard), tablet (tabs), mobile (cards)

**Visualization Libraries:**
- **Recharts:** Line charts, bar charts, scatter plots, radar charts (VARK profile)
- **D3.js (if needed):** Heatmaps, force-directed graphs (pattern evolution timeline)
- **Custom components:** Progress circles, confidence indicators, metric cards

**Accessibility:**
- All charts include ARIA labels and text alternatives
- Color-blind friendly palette (use patterns/textures in addition to color)
- Keyboard navigation for all interactive elements
- Screen reader support for data visualizations

**User Flow:**
1. User has 12+ weeks of study data, patterns detected
2. User receives notification: "3 new behavioral insights ready"
3. User clicks notification â†’ Navigates to `/analytics/behavioral-insights`
4. Dashboard loads with Patterns tab active
5. User explores detected patterns, views evolution timeline
6. User switches to Progress tab, sees academic correlation
7. User switches to Goals tab, creates goal from template
8. User switches to Learn tab, reads spaced repetition article
9. User sees personalized forgetting curve in article
10. User applies recommendation: "Study during 7-9 AM"
11. User tracks goal progress over 2 weeks
12. User sees improvement in behavioral metrics
13. User receives goal achievement notification

### Performance Considerations

1. **Dashboard Loading:** Lazy load tabs (only load active tab content)
2. **Charts:** Implement virtualization for large datasets (>100 points)
3. **Data Caching:** Cache dashboard data for 1 hour, invalidate on new pattern detection
4. **API Pagination:** Limit notifications list to 20 per page
5. **Image Optimization:** Use Next.js Image component for article thumbnails

### Testing Strategy

**Manual Testing (MVP Approach):**
1. Generate 12+ weeks of behavioral data with diverse patterns
2. Trigger pattern analysis to populate dashboard
3. Test each tab: Patterns, Progress, Goals, Learn
4. Create goal, track progress, complete goal
5. Apply recommendation, verify settings updated
6. Read learning science articles, verify personalized sections
7. Test on desktop, tablet, mobile devices
8. Verify notifications appear correctly
9. Test data export and privacy controls

**Edge Cases:**
- User with <6 weeks data (show "insufficient data" messaging)
- User with no detected patterns (confidence too low)
- User disables behavioral analysis (dashboard shows disabled state)
- User has no exam scores (correlation analysis not available)
- User completes all goals (show "Create new goal" CTA)
