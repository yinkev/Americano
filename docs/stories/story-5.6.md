- Papers: Key research studies with open access links

**Personalization:**
- Each article includes "Your Data" section with user's specific patterns
- Recommendations based on user's current challenges
- Interactive visualizations with user's real data

### UX/UI Design Considerations

**Design System Compliance:**
- Glassmorphism: `bg-white/80 backdrop-blur-md` for all cards
- OKLCH colors: NO gradients, use perceptually uniform OKLCH color space
- Charts: Recharts library with OKLCH color palette
- Icons: Lucide React (consistent with rest of app)
- Responsive: Desktop (full dashboard), tablet (tabs), mobile (cards)

**Visualization Libraries:**
- **Recharts:** Line charts, bar charts, scatter plots, radar charts (VARK profile)
- **D3.js (if needed):** Heatmaps, force-directed graphs (pattern evolution timeline)
- **Custom components:** Progress circles, confidence indicators, metric cards

**Accessibility:**
- All charts include ARIA labels and text alternatives
- Color-blind friendly palette (use patterns/textures in addition to color)
- Keyboard navigation for all interactive elements
- Screen reader support for data visualizations

**User Flow:**
1. User has 12+ weeks of study data, patterns detected
2. User receives notification: "3 new behavioral insights ready"
3. User clicks notification â†’ Navigates to `/analytics/behavioral-insights`
4. Dashboard loads with Patterns tab active
5. User explores detected patterns, views evolution timeline
6. User switches to Progress tab, sees academic correlation
7. User switches to Goals tab, creates goal from template
8. User switches to Learn tab, reads spaced repetition article
9. User sees personalized forgetting curve in article
10. User applies recommendation: "Study during 7-9 AM"
11. User tracks goal progress over 2 weeks
12. User sees improvement in behavioral metrics
13. User receives goal achievement notification

### Performance Considerations

1. **Dashboard Loading:** Lazy load tabs (only load active tab content)
2. **Charts:** Implement virtualization for large datasets (>100 points)
3. **Data Caching:** Cache dashboard data for 1 hour, invalidate on new pattern detection
4. **API Pagination:** Limit notifications list to 20 per page
5. **Image Optimization:** Use Next.js Image component for article thumbnails

### Testing Strategy

**Manual Testing (MVP Approach):**
1. Generate 12+ weeks of behavioral data with diverse patterns
2. Trigger pattern analysis to populate dashboard
3. Test each tab: Patterns, Progress, Goals, Learn
4. Create goal, track progress, complete goal
5. Apply recommendation, verify settings updated
6. Read learning science articles, verify personalized sections
7. Test on desktop, tablet, mobile devices
8. Verify notifications appear correctly
9. Test data export and privacy controls

**Edge Cases:**
- User with <6 weeks data (show "insufficient data" messaging)
- User with no detected patterns (confidence too low)
- User disables behavioral analysis (dashboard shows disabled state)
- User has no exam scores (correlation analysis not available)
- User completes all goals (show "Create new goal" CTA)

### Code Quality Analysis

#### TypeScript Type Safety - VERIFIED

**Interface Definitions Present:**
- `BehavioralPattern` - Pattern detection data with confidence scores
- `BehavioralGoal` - Goal tracking with progress history
- `Recommendation` - Actionable suggestions with priority scoring
- `LearningArticle` - Educational content with metadata
- `CorrelationData` - Statistical correlation results

**Type Strictness:**
- No `any` types found in core components (except necessary dangerouslySetInnerHTML for markdown)
- Proper discriminated unions for goal/pattern types
- Generic types properly constrained for reusable components
- All component props properly typed

**TypeScript Compilation Status:**
- Minor warning: `cognitive-load-indicator.tsx` has motion.dev import issues (unrelated to Story 5.6)
- All Story 5.6 components compile without errors
- Strict mode compatible

#### Component Structure

**Component Hierarchy:**
```
BehavioralInsightsDashboard (main page)
â”œâ”€â”€ LearningPatternsGrid
â”œâ”€â”€ PatternEvolutionTimeline
â”œâ”€â”€ PerformanceCorrelationChart
â”œâ”€â”€ BehavioralGoalsSection
â”œâ”€â”€ RecommendationsPanel
â””â”€â”€ LearningArticleReader
```

**Component Organization:**
- Single Responsibility Principle: Each component handles one feature area
- Props are well-defined and typed
- State management appropriate (useState for local UI, API calls for server state)
- Loading/error/empty states handled consistently

#### Accessibility Compliance - VERIFIED

**ARIA Labels:**
- PatternEvolutionTimeline: `role="region"`, `aria-label="Pattern Evolution Timeline"`
- PatternEvolutionTimeline buttons: `aria-label="View previous week"`, etc.
- RecommendationsPanel: `role="article"` for each recommendation
- All expandable sections have `aria-expanded` attributes

**Semantic HTML:**
- Proper use of `<Card>`, `<CardTitle>`, `<CardDescription>` components
- Form inputs have associated `<Label>` elements
- List items use `<ul>` and `<li>` semantic tags
- Buttons use semantic `<Button>` component

**Color-Blind Friendly:**
- Pattern evolution timeline uses distinct shapes and opacity levels (not color-only)
- Correlation chart uses color + text labels for significance
- Status indicators use badges with text (not color-only)

---

### Data Validation Testing

#### Dashboard Data Transformation - VERIFIED

**Pattern Data Transformation:**
```typescript
// Input (from database):
{ id, patternType, confidence, evidence, lastSeenAt, detectedAt }

// Transformed (for component):
{ id, patternType, confidence, metadata: evidence, lastSeenAt, firstSeenAt }
```
- Transformation handles field mapping correctly
- Type casting for `patternType` maintains type safety

**Goal Data Formatting:**
- Deadline formatting uses `format(new Date(goal.deadline), 'MMM d, yyyy')`
- Progress calculation: `Math.min(100, Math.round((currentValue / targetValue) * 100))`
- Date objects properly converted from API responses

#### Input Validation - VERIFIED

**Goal Creation Validation:**
1. Deadline must be in the future (checked before POST)
2. Deadline cannot exceed 90 days from now
3. Target value must be positive (Zod `positive()` schema)
4. Goal type must be valid enum value
5. User ID required

**Recommendation Query Validation:**
1. User ID required (throws 400 if missing)
2. Limit parameter bounded 1-20
3. IncludeApplied parameter boolean conversion safe
