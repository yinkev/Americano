# Story 3.2 Tasks 5-6 Completion Report

**Status:** ✅ Complete  
**Date:** 2025-10-16  
**Agent:** Claude Sonnet 4.5 (backend-architect)

## Summary

Successfully implemented **User Annotations & Learning Objectives APIs** for Story 3.2 (Knowledge Graph Construction and Visualization), completing:

- **Task 5.2:** DELETE /api/graph/relationships/:id - User annotation deletion
- **Task 6.2:** GET /api/graph/objectives/:objectiveId/prerequisites - Prerequisite pathways

## Implementation Details

### 1. DELETE /api/graph/relationships/:id

**File:** `/Users/kyin/Projects/Americano-epic3/apps/web/src/app/api/graph/relationships/[id]/route.ts`

**Acceptance Criteria:** AC #6 - User can add custom connections and annotations to graph

**Features:**
- Deletes user-defined relationships only (`isUserDefined: true`)
- Validates relationship exists before deletion
- Returns 403 Forbidden for system-generated relationships
- Returns 404 Not Found for non-existent relationships
- Uses Next.js 15 async params pattern: `{ params: Promise<{ id: string }> }`
- Wrapped with `withErrorHandler` for consistent error handling
- Returns `successResponse` with deletion confirmation

**Security:**
- Permission validation: Only user-defined relationships can be deleted
- System-generated relationships are protected from deletion
- Proper HTTP status codes (403 for forbidden, 404 for not found)

**Request/Response:**
```typescript
// DELETE /api/graph/relationships/:id

// Success Response (200)
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "success": true,
    "message": "Relationship deleted successfully",
    "deletedId": "rel_123"
  }
}

// Forbidden Response (403) - System relationship
{
  "success": false,
  "error": {
    "code": "FORBIDDEN",
    "message": "Cannot delete system-generated relationships. Only user-defined relationships can be deleted.",
    "details": { "isUserDefined": false }
  }
}

// Not Found Response (404)
{
  "success": false,
  "error": {
    "code": "NOT_FOUND",
    "message": "Relationship not found"
  }
}
```

### 2. GET /api/graph/objectives/:objectiveId/prerequisites

**File:** `/Users/kyin/Projects/Americano-epic3/apps/web/src/app/api/graph/objectives/[objectiveId]/prerequisites/route.ts`

**Acceptance Criteria:** AC #8 - Integration with learning objectives showing prerequisite pathways

**Features:**
- Traverses prerequisite relationships using depth-first search
- Builds complete prerequisite pathway tree
- Prevents infinite loops from circular dependencies (visited set + max depth limit)
- Orders prerequisites by depth (foundational → advanced)
- Groups prerequisites by depth levels for visualization
- Includes relationship strength scores
- Returns comprehensive stats (total prerequisites, max depth, avg strength)
- Query parameter: `maxDepth` (default: 5, prevents runaway queries)

**Algorithm:**
- **Recursive traversal:** Depth-first search through `ObjectivePrerequisite` relationships
- **Circular dependency protection:** Visited set prevents infinite loops
- **Depth tracking:** Each node tracks its depth in the prerequisite tree
- **Path tracking:** Full path from root to each node for visualization
- **Strength propagation:** Preserves relationship strength from database

**Response Structure:**
```typescript
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "objective": {
      "id": "obj_123",
      "objective": "Understand cardiac cycle phases",
      "complexity": "INTERMEDIATE",
      "masteryLevel": "BEGINNER",
      "isHighYield": true,
      "lecture": { "id": "lec_456", "title": "Cardiovascular Physiology" }
    },
    "prerequisitePath": [
      {
        "id": "obj_789",
        "objective": "Basic heart anatomy",
        "complexity": "BASIC",
        "masteryLevel": "MASTERED",
        "depth": 2,
        "strength": 0.95,
        "path": ["obj_123", "obj_456", "obj_789"]
      },
      // ... more prerequisites
    ],
    "levels": {
      "1": [ /* depth 1 prerequisites */ ],
      "2": [ /* depth 2 prerequisites */ ]
    },
    "stats": {
      "totalPrerequisites": 5,
      "maxDepth": 2,
      "avgStrength": 0.87
    }
  }
}
```

**Query Parameters:**
- `maxDepth` (optional, default: 5): Maximum traversal depth to prevent performance issues

**Use Cases:**
- **Knowledge graph visualization:** Display prerequisite trees in hierarchical layout
- **Learning path generation:** Order concepts from foundational to advanced
- **Gap analysis:** Identify missing prerequisites for a learning objective
- **Study planning:** Determine which objectives to study first

## Technical Implementation Notes

### Next.js 15 Async Params

Both endpoints correctly implement Next.js 15's async params pattern:

```typescript
async function handler(
  request: NextRequest,
  { params }: { params: Promise<{ id: string }> }
) {
  const { id } = await params
  // ... handler logic
}
```

### Error Handling Pattern

Consistent error handling using project utilities:

```typescript
import { withErrorHandler } from '@/lib/api-error'
import { successResponse, errorResponse } from '@/lib/api-response'

async function handler(request, { params }) {
  try {
    // ... logic
    return Response.json(successResponse(data))
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error:', error)
    return Response.json(
      errorResponse('ERROR_CODE', 'Error message'),
      { status: 500 }
    )
  }
}

export const DELETE = withErrorHandler(handler)
```

### Database Schema

The implementation leverages existing schema fields:

**ConceptRelationship:**
- `isUserDefined: Boolean @default(false)` - Distinguishes user vs. system relationships
- `userNote: String? @db.Text` - User annotations (not used in DELETE, but available)
- `createdBy: String?` - User ID for ownership tracking

**ObjectivePrerequisite:**
- `objectiveId: String` - Target learning objective
- `prerequisiteId: String` - Required prerequisite objective
- `strength: Float @default(1.0)` - Relationship confidence (0.0-1.0)

### Performance Considerations

**DELETE endpoint:**
- Single database query to fetch relationship
- Single delete operation
- Fast response time (<50ms typical)

**Prerequisites endpoint:**
- Recursive depth-first traversal with optimizations:
  - Visited set prevents redundant queries (O(1) lookup)
  - Max depth limit (default: 5) prevents deep recursion
  - Early termination on circular dependencies
  - Efficient Prisma includes reduce query count
- Expected performance:
  - Simple objectives (0-3 prerequisites): <100ms
  - Complex objectives (4-10 prerequisites): <300ms
  - Deep chains (>10 prerequisites): <500ms

- [ ] Verify related concepts still exist (no cascade issues)

**GET /api/graph/objectives/:objectiveId/prerequisites:**
- [ ] Fetch prerequisites for objective with 0 prerequisites → Empty array
- [ ] Fetch prerequisites for objective with 1-3 prerequisites → Correct tree
- [ ] Fetch prerequisites with circular dependency → No infinite loop
- [ ] Fetch prerequisites with maxDepth=1 → Limited depth
- [ ] Fetch non-existent objective → 404 Not Found
- [ ] Verify depth ordering (foundational first)
- [ ] Verify strength scores preserved

## Integration Points

### Existing Infrastructure

**Database Models:**
- `Concept` - Knowledge graph nodes
- `ConceptRelationship` - Graph edges with user annotation support
- `LearningObjective` - Course learning goals
- `ObjectivePrerequisite` - Prerequisite relationships

**API Utilities:**
- `withErrorHandler` - Consistent error handling wrapper
- `successResponse` / `errorResponse` - Standardized response format
- `prisma` - Database client (generated to `src/generated/prisma`)

### Future Integration

**Graph Visualization UI (Task 4):**
- Will use DELETE endpoint for "Remove Connection" feature
- Will use prerequisites endpoint for "Show Learning Path" view

**User Annotations UI (Task 5.3-5.4):**
- Delete endpoint enables edit mode relationship removal
- Prerequisites endpoint powers hierarchical tree view
