## Cinematic & Camera

### Cinematography Integration

#### Camera Movement Mastery

**Static Shots**:
- `static shot`, `fixed camera`, `locked-off shot`
- **Use Case**: Establishing shots, dialogue scenes, detail focus

**Dynamic Movements**:
- `dolly in/out` - Emotional impact and intimacy control
- `pan left/right` - Scene revelation and information disclosure
- `tilt up/down` - Perspective shifts and scale emphasis
- `tracking shot` - Subject following and spatial awareness
- `crane shot` - Dramatic reveals and environmental context
- `handheld` - Authenticity, energy, documentary feel

#### Camera Position Integration

> **💡 Key Technique**: Veo 3 requires explicit camera positioning using the `"(thats where the camera is)"` syntax for optimal results.

#### Shot Composition Framework

```
Shot Types for Meta Prompts:
- Extreme Wide Shot (EWS): Environmental context and scale
- Wide Shot (WS): Full body in environment
- Medium Shot (MS): Waist up, conversation standard
- Close-Up (CU): Head and shoulders, emotional connection
- Extreme Close-Up (ECU): Eyes/mouth, intense emotion
```

---

### Essential Camera Positioning

> **💡 Key Technique**: Always include `"(thats where the camera is)"` when specifying camera position.
>
> **Why This Works**: Veo 3 requires explicit camera positioning rather than generic viewpoint terms. This phrase triggers camera-aware processing and significantly improves generation success rates.

**Expert Examples**:

```
"Close-up shot with camera positioned at counter level (thats where the camera is)
as the brand ambassador demonstrates the product"

"Handheld camera held at chest height (thats where the camera is) tracking the subject
as they showcase the lifestyle benefits"
```

---

### Effective Dialogue Techniques

**Recommended Dialogue Syntax** (Community-Verified):

```
✅ WORKS - Colon Format (Prevents Subtitles):
"The brand ambassador looks directly at camera and says: 'This product changed my daily
routine completely.' Her voice carries genuine enthusiasm."

❌ FAILS - Quote Format (Causes Subtitles):
"The brand ambassador says 'This product changed my routine'" (Avoid this format)
```

**Dialogue Length Optimization**:
- **Perfect Length**: 8-second rule (12-15 words, 20-25 syllables)
- **Character-Specific**: Always specify who speaks when
- **Tone Specification**: Include emotional delivery style

---

## Characters & Directing

Recommended Dialogue Syntax (Community-Verified):

✅ EFFECTIVE - Colon Format (Prevents Subtitles):
"The [character] looks directly at camera and says: '[dialogue]' with [emotional tone]
and [delivery style]."

❌ PROBLEMATIC - Direct Quote Format (Causes Subtitles):
"The [character] says '[dialogue]'" (No colon - this triggers subtitles)

KEY DIFFERENCE: Use colon (:) before dialogue, avoid direct quotes without colon.
```

**Environmental Audio Specifications**:

**Professional Quality**:
```
Audio: clean studio acoustics, professional microphone quality, minimal background noise,
broadcast-standard clarity
