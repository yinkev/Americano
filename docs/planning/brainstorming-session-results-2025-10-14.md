**Session Goals:** Design a world-class learning engine personalized for medical school success with evidence-based techniques, adaptive learning, and psychological profiling

**Techniques Used:** First Principles Thinking, SCAMPER Method, Assumption Reversal, Crazy 8s

**Total Ideas Generated:** 45+

### Key Themes Identified:

1. **Learning Navigation & Prioritization** - Solving "what to study" anxiety
2. **Personalization at Individual Level** - N=1 optimization for your specific brain
3. **Understanding vs Memorization** - Detecting and preventing pattern matching
4. **Psychological Profiling** - Learning your learning patterns
5. **Evidence-Based Techniques** - Retrieval practice, spaced repetition, controlled failure

## Technique Sessions

### First Principles Thinking (15 min)

**Core Problems Identified:**
- No learning GPS (don't know what to study or why)
- No importance hierarchy (everything seems equally important)
- Generic tools not personalized to individual
- No validation of true understanding vs pattern matching
- Missing clinical context for retention

**Fundamental Insights:**
- Learning happens through struggle and retrieval, not passive reading
- Your brain needs to know WHY something matters to retain it
- Anxiety about "missing something" hurts learning efficiency

### SCAMPER Method (20 min)

**Substitute:**
- Replace manual planning with AI-driven daily missions
- Replace generic flashcards with personalized comprehension checks
- Replace platform-hopping with unified knowledge system

**Combine:**
- Merge lecture PDFs + First Aid + AMBOSS + Bootcamp into single truth source
- Combine all resources into unified knowledge graph with reconciliation engine

**Adapt:**
- Gaming mechanics (daily quests, XP, streaks)
- Trading portfolio view (knowledge assets)
- GPS navigation (recalculating based on exam priorities)

**Modify/Magnify:**
- Amplify high-yield content, minimize low-yield noise
- Confidence calibration system
- Professor pattern decoder

**Put to Other Uses:**
- Study data becomes predictive analytics
- Learning patterns for study buddy matching
- Behavioral data for psychological profiling

**Eliminate:**
- Kill re-reading (replace with active recall)
- Remove guessing importance (AI priorities)
- End platform switching (everything in one place)
- Stop cramming (forced distributed practice)

**Reverse:**
- Start with exam requirements, work backwards to content
- Learn by teaching the AI
- Intentional forgetting for stronger retrieval

### Assumption Reversal (15 min)

**Key Reversals:**
1. Learning through forgetting > repetition
2. Less study with perfect timing > more study time
3. Testing IS learning, not evaluation
4. Memorizing patterns first can enable understanding
5. Controlled failure creates stronger memories
6. Chaos/stress can improve retention vs consistent study

**Research-Backed Insights:**
- Retrieval practice effect (testing effect) proven in 2024 studies
- Desirable difficulties framework validates struggle-based learning
- Forward testing effect - testing Topic A improves Topic B learning

### Crazy 8s Wild Card (10 min)

1. **Mirror Study Mode** - Learn by teaching your digital twin
2. **Dream Review** - Consolidate learning during sleep
3. **Panic Button** - Emergency 3-hour cram optimizer
4. **Medical Mistake Museum** - Emotional anchoring through failure visualization
5. **Attending Simulator** - Practice with different personality types
6. **Knowledge Decay Visualizer** - Watch knowledge literally fade
7. **Study Parasite** - Hijack social media scrolling for micro-learning
8. **Confidence Destroyer Mode** - Strategic humility through controlled failure
