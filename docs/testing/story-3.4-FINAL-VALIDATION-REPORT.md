## Implementation Review Summary

### ✅ Completed Components

#### 1. Conflict Detection Engine (`conflict-detector.ts` - 918 lines)

**Features Implemented:**
- **Semantic Similarity Analysis**
  - Cosine similarity calculation using Gemini embeddings (1536 dimensions)
  - Threshold: 0.85 for topical similarity detection
  - Handles missing embeddings gracefully (generates on-the-fly)

- **Medical Terminology Normalization**
  - 18 common medical term variants (MI, CHF, AFib, DM, CKD, etc.)
  - Maps variants to canonical terms for consistent comparison
  - Reduces false positives from terminology differences

- **5 Contradiction Pattern Detectors:**
  1. **Negation Pattern:** Detects affirmation vs negation ("is" vs "is not")
  2. **Opposing Terms:** Detects contradictory pairs (increase/decrease, effective/ineffective, safe/unsafe)
  3. **Numerical Conflicts:** Detects divergent values (>20% difference with same units)
  4. **Dosage Conflicts:** Detects medication dosing discrepancies (drug name + dose + unit comparison)
  5. **Certainty Conflicts:** Detects frequency disagreements (always/commonly vs rarely/may)

- **GPT-5 Powered AI Analysis**
  - Medical context-aware prompting
  - Distinguishes true conflicts from: different detail levels, context-dependent recommendations, updated knowledge, different patient populations
  - Outputs: conflict classification, severity, explanation, resolution recommendation, confidence score, key differences
  - Temperature: 0.3 (low for consistency)
  - Max tokens: 16000 (high to avoid truncation)
  - Fallback to pattern-based analysis if GPT-5 unavailable

- **Confidence Scoring & Severity Classification**
  - Confidence: 0.0-1.0 based on pattern strength + AI assessment
  - Severity: LOW, MEDIUM, HIGH, CRITICAL (dosage conflicts ≥ MEDIUM)
  - CRITICAL severity for life-threatening contradictions (e.g., 10x dosage errors)

**Performance Optimization:**
- Vector similarity pre-filtering to reduce N×N comparisons
- Skips same-lecture chunks (not cross-source conflicts)
- Batch processing support with configurable limits
- Error handling continues scanning even if one pair fails

## Performance Validation Plan

### Targets

| Metric | Target | How to Measure |
|--------|--------|----------------|
| Conflict Detection (per concept) | <500ms | `scanTime` in POST /api/conflicts/detect response |
| API List Retrieval | <200ms | `latency` in GET /api/conflicts response |
| API Detail Retrieval | <300ms | `latency` in GET /api/conflicts/:id response |
| UI Modal Load Time | <300ms | Browser DevTools Network tab |

### Test Approach

1. **Load Testing:**
   - Use ApacheBench or k6 to simulate concurrent requests
   - Test with 10, 50, 100, 500 concurrent users
   - Measure P50, P95, P99 latencies

2. **Database Optimization:**
   - Run EXPLAIN ANALYZE on conflict queries
   - Verify indexes used: [conceptId, status], severity, createdAt
   - Check for N+1 query problems (should use includes/joins)

3. **Caching:**
   - Implement Redis caching for conflict detection results
   - Cache invalidation when sources update
   - Test cache hit/miss ratios

---

## Accuracy Testing Plan

### Test Dataset

**Created:** `/Users/kyin/Projects/Americano-epic3/docs/testing/story-3.4-test-dataset.json`

**Contents:**
- 30 total test cases
- 12 True Positives (should detect conflicts)
- 10 True Negatives (should NOT detect conflicts)
- 8 Edge Cases (complex scenarios)

**Categories:**
- Dosage conflicts (aspirin 81mg vs 325mg, epinephrine 1mg vs 0.1mg)
- Contraindication conflicts (beta-blockers in heart failure)
- Mechanism conflicts (aspirin COX selectivity)
- Treatment conflicts (antibiotics for URI)
- Diagnosis conflicts (MI criteria)
- Prognosis conflicts (pancreatic cancer survival)
- Numerical conflicts (temperature, heart rate thresholds)
- Certainty conflicts (ACE inhibitor cough frequency)

**Edge Cases:**
- Subtle contradictions
- Implicit contradictions ("reduces mortality" vs "no mortality benefit")
- Evolving medical consensus
- Conditional statements (indication vs contraindication)
- Range overlaps
- Guideline disagreements (ACS vs USPSTF mammography)

### Accuracy Metrics

**Target:**
- Precision (TP / (TP + FP)) ≥ 85%
- Recall (TP / (TP + FN)) ≥ 85%
- False Positive Rate ≤ 10%
- Overall Accuracy ≥ 90%

### Testing Process

1. Load test cases into system
2. Run `conflictDetector.detectConflicts()` for each pair
3. Compare actual results with `expectedResult`
4. Calculate confusion matrix:
   - True Positives (TP)
   - False Positives (FP)
   - True Negatives (TN)
   - False Negatives (FN)
5. Calculate metrics: precision, recall, accuracy, FPR
6. Identify patterns in errors
7. Refine detection algorithm if needed
8. Re-test until targets met

---

## Known Issues and Limitations

### 🔴 Critical Gap: Concept-to-Chunk Mapping

**File:** `conflict-detector.ts` Lines 898-902
**Issue:** `getChunksForConcept()` returns empty array (TODO comment)

```typescript
private async getChunksForConcept(conceptId: string): Promise<ContentChunk[]> {
  // For now, return empty array
  // This will be implemented when concept-to-lecture mapping is added
  return []
}
```

**Impact:**
- Cannot scan conflicts by conceptId parameter (only by sourceIds)
- Limits usability of POST /api/conflicts/detect endpoint

**Workaround:**
- Use `sourceIds` parameter instead of `conceptId`
- Example: `{ sourceIds: ['course-id-1', 'course-id-2'] }`

**Recommendation:**
- Implement concept-to-lecture mapping via knowledge graph relationships
- Query: `Concept → ConceptRelationship → Lecture → ContentChunk`

---

### 🟡 Medium Priority: Source Seed Data Missing

**Expected Location:** `prisma/seed-sources.ts`
**Status:** Not found

**Impact:**
- Cannot test source credibility scoring without populated sources
- AC #3 partially unvalidated

**Recommendation:**
- Create seed script with medical sources:
  ```typescript
  // First Aid
  { name: 'First Aid USMLE Step 1 2026', type: 'FIRST_AID', credibilityScore: 95 }

  // Journals
  { name: 'New England Journal of Medicine', type: 'JOURNAL', credibilityScore: 90 }
  { name: 'JAMA', type: 'JOURNAL', credibilityScore: 90 }
  { name: 'The Lancet', type: 'JOURNAL', credibilityScore: 90 }

  // Guidelines
  { name: 'AHA/ACC Guidelines', type: 'GUIDELINE', credibilityScore: 95 }
  { name: 'ACLS Protocol', type: 'GUIDELINE', credibilityScore: 95 }

  // Textbooks
  { name: 'Robbins Pathology', type: 'TEXTBOOK', credibilityScore: 85 }
  { name: 'Harrisons Internal Medicine', type: 'TEXTBOOK', credibilityScore: 85 }

  // Lectures (user-specific, lower credibility)
  { name: 'User Lecture Notes', type: 'LECTURE', credibilityScore: 70 }
  ```

---

### 🟢 Low Priority: Settings UI Not Confirmed

**Referenced:** `/settings/sources` page (Test 1.6 in validation plan)
**Status:** Not examined

**Impact:**
- Cannot visually test user source preferences (AC #8)
- API functionality exists, UI may be missing

**Recommendation:**
- Verify if settings page exists:
  ```bash
  find /Users/kyin/Projects/Americano-epic3/apps/web/src/app -name "settings" -type d
  ```
- If missing, create settings page with:
  - List of all sources
  - Trust level selector (HIGH, MEDIUM, LOW, BLOCKED)
  - Priority ranking (drag-and-drop or number input)
  - Notes textarea
  - Save button

---

### 🟢 Low Priority: Hard-Coded User ID

**Location:** All API routes
**Code:** `const userId = 'kevy@americano.dev'`
**Status:** Expected (Story 1.5 constraint for MVP)

**Impact:**
- Cannot test multi-user scenarios
- All conflicts/flags/resolutions attributed to single user

**Recommendation:**
- Acceptable for MVP testing
- Replace with real authentication in post-MVP
- Use Supabase auth or similar

---

### 🟢 Low Priority: Notification System Not Implemented

**Referenced:** Test 4.3 in validation plan (notification system)
**Status:** Not found

**Impact:**
- Users don't receive alerts for new high-severity conflicts
- Reduces proactive conflict awareness

**Recommendation:**
- Implement toast notifications for conflict detection
- Add email digest option (daily/weekly)
- Dashboard widget for unresolved conflicts
- Use React Context or Zustand for notification state

---
