---

### Phase 3: Accuracy Testing

**Objective:** Calculate precision/recall for conflict detection (>85% TP, <10% FP)

#### Test 3.1: Create Medical Test Dataset

**Test Cases:**

1. **True Positives (Should Detect):**
   - Dosage conflicts: "Aspirin 81mg" vs "Aspirin 325mg" (same indication)
   - Contraindication conflicts: "Absolutely contraindicated" vs "Safe to use"
   - Mechanism conflicts: "Inhibits COX-1" vs "Inhibits COX-2"
   - Treatment protocol conflicts: "First-line therapy" vs "Last resort option"
   - Numerical conflicts: "30% mortality" vs "50% mortality" (same study)

2. **True Negatives (Should NOT Detect):**
   - Different levels of detail: Simple explanation vs comprehensive mechanism
   - Context-dependent: "Aspirin 81mg prophylaxis" vs "Aspirin 325mg acute MI"
   - Medical terminology variants: "MI" vs "myocardial infarction" vs "heart attack"
   - Updated knowledge: "2020 guideline" vs "2024 updated guideline" (not contradictory, just updated)
   - Different patient populations: "Pediatric dose" vs "Adult dose"

3. **False Positives (Should Avoid):**
   - Stylistic differences: "May cause" vs "Can cause"
   - Certainty wording: "Usually" vs "Commonly" (synonyms, not contradictions)
   - Minor numerical differences within error margins: "30%" vs "32%"

4. **False Negatives (Should Minimize):**
   - Subtle contradictions: "Rarely causes side effects" vs "Common adverse reactions include..."
   - Implicit contradictions: "Increases survival" vs "No mortality benefit"

**Test Execution:**
```typescript
// Pseudocode for accuracy testing
const testCases = [
  { id: 'TP1', sourceA: "...", sourceB: "...", expected: true, type: 'DOSAGE' },
  { id: 'TN1', sourceA: "...", sourceB: "...", expected: false },
  // ... 100 test cases
]

let truePositives = 0
let falsePositives = 0
let trueNegatives = 0
let falseNegatives = 0

for (const testCase of testCases) {
  const result = await conflictDetector.detectConflicts(
    testCase.sourceA,
    testCase.sourceB
  )

  const detected = result !== null

  if (testCase.expected && detected) truePositives++
  else if (!testCase.expected && detected) falsePositives++
  else if (!testCase.expected && !detected) trueNegatives++
  else if (testCase.expected && !detected) falseNegatives++
}

const precision = truePositives / (truePositives + falsePositives)
const recall = truePositives / (truePositives + falseNegatives)
const accuracy = (truePositives + trueNegatives) / testCases.length

console.log(`Precision: ${(precision * 100).toFixed(1)}%`)
console.log(`Recall: ${(recall * 100).toFixed(1)}%`)
console.log(`Accuracy: ${(accuracy * 100).toFixed(1)}%`)
console.log(`False Positive Rate: ${((falsePositives / (falsePositives + trueNegatives)) * 100).toFixed(1)}%`)
```

**Success Criteria:**
- Precision (TP / (TP + FP)) ≥ 85%
- Recall (TP / (TP + FN)) ≥ 85%
- False Positive Rate ≤ 10%
- Accuracy ≥ 90%

---

#### Test 3.2: Medical Expert Review

**Setup:**
- Select 20 representative conflicts detected by the system
- Have medical expert (or proxy with medical knowledge) review each

**Review Questions:**
1. Is this a true conflict or false positive?
2. Is the severity classification appropriate (LOW, MEDIUM, HIGH, CRITICAL)?
3. Is the conflict description accurate and clear?
4. Does the AI resolution recommendation make medical sense?
5. Are there any dangerous false negatives (conflicts the system missed)?

**Success Criteria:**
- Expert agreement with system classification ≥ 80%
- No critical false negatives that could endanger patients
- Severity classifications match expert judgment ≥ 85%

---

### Phase 4: E2E Testing

## Known Issues and Limitations

### Implementation Gaps Identified

1. **Concept-to-Chunk Mapping (Line 898-902 in conflict-detector.ts):**
   - `getChunksForConcept()` returns empty array (TODO comment)
   - **Impact:** Cannot scan conflicts by concept ID yet, only by source IDs
   - **Workaround:** Use sourceIds parameter instead of conceptId
   - **Recommendation:** Implement concept-to-lecture mapping via knowledge graph relationships

2. **EBM Evaluator Integration:**
   - `ebmEvaluator.compareEvidence()` imported but implementation details unknown
   - **Impact:** Cannot fully validate AC #7 without examining ebm-evaluator.ts
   - **Recommendation:** Review /Users/kyin/Projects/Americano-epic3/apps/web/src/lib/ebm-evaluator.ts file

3. **Source Credibility Database:**
   - Source model exists in schema but no seed data found
   - **Impact:** Cannot test source credibility scoring without populated sources
   - **Recommendation:** Create `prisma/seed-sources.ts` with medical source credibility data

4. **User Authentication:**
   - Hard-coded userId = 'kevy@americano.dev' (Story 1.5 constraint)
   - **Impact:** Cannot test multi-user scenarios or user-specific preferences
   - **Workaround:** Acceptable for MVP testing
   - **Recommendation:** Replace with real auth in post-MVP

5. **Settings UI:**
   - `/settings/sources` page referenced but implementation not confirmed
   - **Impact:** Cannot test AC #8 user preferences without settings UI
   - **Recommendation:** Verify if settings page exists, create if missing
