# Session Summary: Epic 4 Development (Paused)

**Date:** 2025-10-16
**Agent:** Amelia (DEV Agent - Claude Sonnet 4.5)
**User:** Kevy
**Status:** PAUSED - Epic 4 Development

## What We Attempted

### Story 4.1: Natural Language Comprehension Prompts
- **Goal:** Implement AI-powered "Explain to a patient" comprehension validation
- **Status:** Database schema designed but NOT applied to database
- **Progress:** Task 1 (Database Schema Extensions) - IN PROGRESS

### Work Completed

1. **Loaded Story Context**
   - Story file: `docs/stories/story-4.1.md`
   - Context file: `docs/stories/story-context-4.1.xml`
   - All 10 tasks identified with 70+ subtasks

2. **Schema Design (NOT APPLIED)**
   - Extended `ValidationPrompt` model with `promptData` JSON field for template variation
   - Extended `ValidationResponse` model with comprehension-specific fields:
     - `confidenceLevel` (Int 1-5)
     - `calibrationDelta` (Float)
     - `detailedFeedback` (Json with subscores, strengths, gaps, calibration note)
   - Extended `ComprehensionMetric` model with:
     - `objectiveId` (String? FK to LearningObjective)
     - `userId` (String) for per-user tracking
   - Added indexes for performance

3. **Story 5.1 Schema Preservation**
   - Discovered database had Story 5.1 behavioral analytics already applied
   - Added Story 5.1 models to local schema to prevent data loss:
     - `BehavioralPattern`
     - `BehavioralInsight`
     - `InsightPattern`
     - `UserLearningProfile`
   - Added Story 5.1 enums:
     - `BehavioralPatternType`
     - `CompletionQuality`
     - `EngagementLevel`
     - `InsightType`

## Files Modified (NOT COMMITTED)

### Changed Files
- `apps/web/prisma/schema.prisma` - Schema extensions for Story 4.1 and Story 5.1
- `docs/bmm-workflow-status.md` - Story 4.1 status updates

### Created Files (Untracked)
- `apps/web/.env.local` - Environment configuration for database
- `docs/stories/story-4.1.md` - Story 4.1 definition
- `docs/stories/story-4.2.md` - Story 4.2 definition
- `docs/stories/story-4.3.md` - Story 4.3 definition
- `docs/stories/story-4.4.md` - Story 4.4 definition
- `docs/stories/story-4.5.md` - Story 4.5 definition
- `docs/stories/story-4.6.md` - Story 4.6 definition
- `docs/stories/story-context-4.1.xml` - Story 4.1 implementation context

## Database Status

**IMPORTANT:** No database changes were applied!

- Schema changes are in `prisma/schema.prisma` but NOT pushed to database
- Database is still at previous state (Story 5.1 applied)
- Migration `story_4_1_comprehension_validation` was NOT created or applied

## Next Steps When Resuming Epic 4

### Option 1: Continue with Story 4.1
1. **Manual Cleanup Required:**
   ```bash
   # Remove git lock file manually
   rm -f /Users/kyin/Projects/Americano/.git/worktrees/Americano-epic4/index.lock

   # Restore schema to clean state
   git restore apps/web/prisma/schema.prisma
   ```

2. **Resume from Task 1:**
   - Re-apply schema changes for Story 4.1 only
   - Handle Story 5.1 drift properly (either pull migration or baseline)
   - Apply migration: `DATABASE_URL="postgresql://kyin@localhost:5432/americano" npx prisma db push`

3. **Continue with remaining tasks:**
   - Task 2: Prompt Generation Engine (ValidationPromptGenerator class)
   - Task 3: AI Evaluation Engine (ResponseEvaluator with 4-dimension rubric)
   - Task 4: API Endpoints (generate, submit, metrics)
   - Task 5: ComprehensionPromptDialog UI component
   - Task 6: Session Integration
   - Task 7: Analytics Page
   - Task 8: Prompt Variation System
   - Task 9: Calibration Insights Engine
   - Task 10: Testing and Validation

### Option 2: Discard Epic 4 Work
```bash
# Remove git lock
rm -f /Users/kyin/Projects/Americano/.git/worktrees/Americano-epic4/index.lock

# Discard all changes
git restore apps/web/prisma/schema.prisma
git restore docs/bmm-workflow-status.md
git clean -fd  # Remove untracked files (careful!)
```

## Key Learnings

### Database Drift Issue
- **Problem:** Database had Story 5.1 migration applied that wasn't in local migration history
- **Impact:** Prevented clean migration for Story 4.1
- **Solution Applied:** Added Story 5.1 schema to local to prevent data loss
- **Better Approach:** Coordinate database state with migration files before starting new stories

### AGENTS.MD Protocol Followed
- âœ… Fetched Prisma documentation from context7 MCP before schema changes
- âœ… Used verified current Prisma patterns (Json fields, indexes, relations)
- âœ… Preserved exact medical terminology per protocol
- âœ… No gradients, OKLCH colors referenced in prep for UI work

### Story Context Utilization
- Story context file provided comprehensive blueprint
- All 8 acceptance criteria mapped to 10 tasks
- Technical constraints clearly documented
- Integration points with Stories 2.1, 2.4, 2.5 identified

---

## Recommendations

### Before Resuming
1. **Sync with main branch** to get latest schema state
2. **Verify database migration history** matches local files
3. **Consider using `prisma migrate dev`** instead of `db push` for proper migration tracking
4. **Backup database** before applying schema changes

### For Story 4.1 Implementation
1. **Use specialized agents** as requested:
   - Backend agent for API endpoints
   - Frontend agent for UI components
   - Each agent should read AGENTS.MD and fetch context7 docs
2. **Follow BMAD workflow** strictly:
   - Task 1 â†’ Task 2 â†’ ... â†’ Task 10 in order
   - Mark tasks complete immediately after finishing
   - Run tests continuously, not just at end
3. **Maintain Story Context** as single source of truth

## Session Conclusion

**Status:** Epic 4 (Story 4.1) paused at user request ("nvm lets do epic4 later")

**Work Saved:** All schema design documented but not applied to database

**Todo List:** Cleared

**Git Status:** Changes not committed (lock file prevents git operations - manual cleanup needed)

**Agent:** Amelia signing off - ready to resume Epic 4 or work on other priorities when Kevy returns! ðŸ‘‹

## Cleanup Checklist for Kevy

- [ ] Manually remove git lock: `rm -f /Users/kyin/Projects/Americano/.git/worktrees/Americano-epic4/index.lock`
- [ ] Decide: Continue Epic 4 or discard changes
- [ ] If continuing: Sync database migration state first
- [ ] If discarding: `git restore` and `git clean -fd`
- [ ] Review Story 5.1 migration drift issue
- [ ] Update bmm-workflow-status.md with decision
