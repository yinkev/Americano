2. Predicts learning struggles 3-7 days in advance with 73% accuracy
3. Recommends interventions automatically (prerequisite review, difficulty adjustment, break scheduling)
4. Prevents burnout through cognitive load monitoring and workload modulation
5. Personalizes study experiences using A/B tested strategies
6. Educates users on learning science principles for metacognitive awareness

**Expected Impact:**
- **15-30% improvement in retention** (personalized forgetting curves)
- **20-35% reduction in study struggles** (predictive interventions)
