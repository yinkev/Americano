## What Could Improve

### Quality & Testing

1. **Low Test Coverage (16%)**
   - **Impact:** High risk of regressions, difficult to validate changes
   - **Root Cause:** MVP velocity prioritized over test development
   - **Lesson:** Allocate 20% of story effort to testing, even in MVP phase
   - **Action:** Add critical path tests before UAT

2. **Type Safety Violations (61 `as any` assertions)**
   - **Impact:** Reduced TypeScript benefits, potential runtime errors
   - **Root Cause:** Quick workarounds to bypass complex typing challenges
   - **Lesson:** Invest time in proper typing upfront, avoid shortcuts
   - **Action:** Systematic `as any` elimination pass

3. **Incomplete Features (10 TODO items)**
   - **Impact:** Story "100% complete" status misleading
   - **Root Cause:** Marking stories complete before all acceptance criteria fully functional
   - **Lesson:** Define "complete" more rigorously - no TODOs, no placeholders
   - **Action:** Create Story 5.5.1 for completion items

### Observability & Operations

4. **No Production Monitoring (42% coverage)**
   - **Impact:** Cannot measure real-world effectiveness, blind to failures
   - **Root Cause:** Observability treated as "nice to have" vs "must have"
   - **Lesson:** Observability is NOT optional - build it in from day 1
   - **Action:** 118-hour observability sprint before UAT

5. **Missing SLO/SLI Definitions**
   - **Impact:** No objective success criteria for production
   - **Root Cause:** Focus on features over operational excellence
   - **Lesson:** Define SLOs in story ACs, not after implementation
   - **Action:** Backfill SLOs for all Epic 5 endpoints

6. **No Alerting System**
   - **Impact:** Silent failures, model drift undetected
   - **Root Cause:** Assumed manual monitoring sufficient for MVP
   - **Lesson:** Automated alerting essential even for single-user MVP
   - **Action:** PagerDuty integration for critical paths

### Documentation & Process

7. **Schema Drift Issues**
   - **Impact:** 60% of endpoints untested, hours lost to debugging
   - **Root Cause:** Prisma Client not regenerated after schema changes
   - **Lesson:** Add `prisma generate` to development workflow automation
   - **Action:** Pre-commit hook for schema validation

8. **Inconsistent Story Status**
   - **Impact:** Status file shows "Draft" despite 100% implementation
   - **Root Cause:** Manual status updates, easy to forget
   - **Lesson:** Automate status tracking, single source of truth
   - **Action:** Update workflow to auto-sync story status

9. **TEA Assessment Delayed**
   - **Impact:** Critical issues discovered late (after implementation)
   - **Root Cause:** TEA conducted at end of epic vs during each story
   - **Lesson:** Run lightweight TEA per story, comprehensive at epic boundary
   - **Action:** Add TEA checklist to story-ready workflow

## Lessons Learned

### Process Improvements

1. **Test-First for ML Components**
   - ML predictions require extensive testing (edge cases, performance, accuracy)
   - **New Practice:** Write test cases during story drafting, implement tests with code
   - **Benefit:** Catch model drift early, validate accuracy claims

2. **Observability as Acceptance Criteria**
   - Each story should include monitoring/logging/alerting ACs
   - **New Practice:** Add "AC#9: Metrics & Alerts" to all future stories
   - **Benefit:** Production-ready from day 1, no observability backlog

3. **Incremental Schema Validation**
   - Catch schema drift before it blocks development
   - **New Practice:** Add `pnpm prisma generate && pnpm tsc --noEmit` to pre-commit hook
   - **Benefit:** Zero schema-related blocking issues

4. **Per-Story Code Review**
   - Waiting until epic completion creates massive review backlog
   - **New Practice:** Run code-review agent after each story completion
   - **Benefit:** Catch issues early, smaller review scope, faster feedback

### Technical Decisions

5. **Python for ML > TypeScript**
   - Python's ML ecosystem (scikit-learn, numpy, pandas) far superior
   - **Validation:** Story 5.3 ML service is world-class, would be painful in TypeScript
   - **Carry Forward:** Use Python for all ML/data science features

6. **Redis Caching Critical for Real-Time**
   - 98% speedup for burnout risk (280ms → 18ms)
   - **Validation:** Real-time cognitive load monitoring requires sub-100ms
   - **Carry Forward:** Cache all frequently-accessed analytics

7. **Composite Indexes >> Individual Indexes**
   - 75-91% query improvement from 27 strategic composite indexes
   - **Validation:** Single-column indexes insufficient for complex queries
   - **Carry Forward:** Design indexes based on actual query patterns, not assumptions

8. **Glassmorphism > Gradients**
   - User feedback: glassmorphism cleaner, more professional
   - **Validation:** Design system compliance (NO gradients) enforced successfully
   - **Carry Forward:** Continue glassmorphism, resist gradient temptation

### Integration Patterns

9. **Centralized Orchestrator (Story 5.5) > Point-to-Point**
   - PersonalizationEngine successfully orchestrates 4 subsystems
   - **Validation:** Avoids spaghetti integration, single truth source
   - **Carry Forward:** Use orchestrator pattern for multi-subsystem features

10. **Real Data Integration > Mock Data**
    - Story 5.6 dashboard with real data from Stories 5.1-5.5 validates entire epic
    - **Validation:** Mock data hides integration issues, real data forces quality
    - **Carry Forward:** Integrate real data sources early, not at end

## Epic 6 Preparation (Next Epic Preview)

### Identifying Next Epic

**Available Epics:**
- Epic 3: Knowledge Graph & Resource Integration (6 stories)
- Epic 4: Understanding Validation & Smart Testing (6 stories)
- Epic 6: Advanced Personalization & Gamification (future - not yet drafted)

**Recommendation:** Epic 3 (Knowledge Graph)
- **Rationale:** Builds on Epic 2 (missions) and Epic 5 (behavioral patterns) to create intelligent content recommendations
- **Business Value:** Differentiation through medical knowledge graph integration
- **Technical Fit:** Leverages existing pgvector infrastructure, VARK profiling from Story 5.1
- **User Impact:** Better content discovery, prerequisite-aware learning paths

### Dependencies on Epic 5

If Epic 3 selected:

**Story 3.1 (Concept Extraction):**
- Depends on: Story 2.1 (LearningObjective model)
- Integration: Use behavioral patterns from Story 5.1 for concept prioritization

**Story 3.2 (Knowledge Graph):**
- Depends on: Epic 5 complete (no blocking dependencies)
- Integration: Use VARK profiles from Story 5.1 for content type recommendations

**Story 3.3 (Resource Discovery):**
- Depends on: Epic 5 complete (no blocking dependencies)
- Integration: Use struggle predictions from Story 5.2 for proactive resource suggestions

**Story 3.4 (Prerequisite Visualization):**
- Depends on: Story 2.1 (ObjectivePrerequisite model)
- Integration: Use cognitive load from Story 5.4 to adjust prerequisite depth

**Story 3.5 (Content Recommendations):**
- Depends on: Epic 5 complete (especially Stories 5.1, 5.2, 5.5)
- Integration: PersonalizationEngine from Story 5.5 orchestrates content personalization

**Story 3.6 (Knowledge Gaps):**
- Depends on: Epic 5 complete (no blocking dependencies)
- Integration: Use performance tracking from Story 2.2 for gap identification

### Potential Gaps / Preparation Needed

1. **Technical Prerequisites:**
   - ✅ pgvector already configured (Story 1.2)
   - ✅ Gemini embeddings client ready (Story 1.2)
   - ✅ VARK profiling data available (Story 5.1)
   - ⚠️ Graph database needed? (Neo4j vs PostgreSQL recursive CTEs)

2. **Knowledge Gaps to Fill:**
   - Medical ontology research (UMLS, SNOMED CT, MeSH)
   - Knowledge graph design patterns
   - Graph traversal algorithms for prerequisite chains
   - D3.js for knowledge graph visualization

3. **Refactoring Needed Before Epic 3:**
   - ✅ No blocking refactoring identified
   - ⚠️ Consider extracting VARK logic from Story 5.1 into shared utility (DRY)

4. **Documentation to Create:**
   - Knowledge graph data model specification
   - Ontology integration strategy
   - Graph query performance benchmarks

5. **Tools/Infrastructure to Provision:**
   - Decision: Neo4j vs PostgreSQL for graph storage
   - D3.js or alternative graph visualization library
   - Medical ontology API access (UMLS requires license)

### Critical Path for Epic 3

**Blockers to Resolve Before Starting:**

1. **Epic 5 P0 Items** (Must complete before Epic 3):
   - Fix Prisma schema drift (2-4 hours)
   - Fix stress profile error handling (30 minutes)
   - Add critical test coverage (12-16 hours)
   - **Total:** ~15-21 hours

2. **Observability Foundation** (Can run in parallel with Epic 3):
   - Phase 1: OpenTelemetry + Prometheus + PagerDuty (36 hours)
   - Can begin Epic 3 Story 3.1 while Phase 1 in progress

3. **Graph Storage Decision** (Must decide before Story 3.2):
   - PostgreSQL recursive CTEs (pros: already have PostgreSQL, cons: slower for deep traversal)
   - Neo4j (pros: graph-native performance, cons: new infrastructure, cost)
   - **Recommendation:** Start with PostgreSQL, migrate to Neo4j if performance insufficient

4. **Medical Ontology Access** (Must secure before Story 3.1):
   - UMLS requires free license application (1-2 weeks approval)
   - **Action:** Apply for UMLS license immediately

**Dependencies Timeline:**

```
Week 1:
├─ Complete Epic 5 P0 items (15-21 hours)
├─ Apply for UMLS license (submitted)
└─ Graph storage decision (PostgreSQL chosen)

Week 2:
├─ Observability Phase 1 (background)
├─ UMLS license approval (waiting)
└─ Story 3.1 draft + implementation (can start)

Week 3:
├─ Observability Phase 1 complete
├─ UMLS license approved (expected)
└─ Stories 3.1-3.2 implementation
```

### Risk Assessment

**Potential Issues Based on Epic 5 Experience:**

1. **Risk:** Graph query performance degradation with large datasets
   - **Likelihood:** Medium
   - **Impact:** High (user experience)
   - **Mitigation:** Benchmark early with 10K+ concepts, plan Neo4j migration path
   - **Early Warning:** Query times >500ms on moderate graphs

2. **Risk:** Medical ontology integration complexity
   - **Likelihood:** High (based on UMLS documentation)
   - **Impact:** Medium (can use simpler ontology for MVP)
   - **Mitigation:** Prototype with simple ontology first, UMLS as enhancement
   - **Early Warning:** UMLS API rate limits, mapping accuracy <80%

3. **Risk:** D3.js graph visualization performance
   - **Likelihood:** Medium (large graphs = slow rendering)
   - **Impact:** Medium (user experience)
   - **Mitigation:** Implement graph level-of-detail, lazy loading, WebGL fallback
   - **Early Warning:** Rendering >3 seconds for 100+ node graph

4. **Risk:** Observability debt accumulation
   - **Likelihood:** High (Epic 5 pattern)
   - **Impact:** High (production blindness)
   - **Mitigation:** Enforce "AC#9: Metrics & Alerts" in all Epic 3 stories
   - **Early Warning:** No metrics added in first 2 Epic 3 stories

5. **Risk:** Test coverage continuing to decline
   - **Likelihood:** High (Epic 5 pattern)
   - **Impact:** High (quality degradation)
   - **Mitigation:** Minimum 60% coverage gate for story approval
   - **Early Warning:** Coverage <40% after 2 Epic 3 stories
