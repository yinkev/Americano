# Epic 4 Retrospective — Understanding Validation Engine

**Date:** 2025-10-20  
**Facilitator:** Kevy (Scrum Master)  
**Participants:** Kevy (PM/SM), Amelia (DEV), Claude (Analyst), Bob (SM), Alice (QA/TEA)

## 1. Executive Summary

Epic 4 delivered the complete Understanding Validation Engine across six stories (4.1–4.6) with a total of **~78 story points** in **3 working days (2025-10-15 → 2025-10-17)**. Feature coverage includes comprehension prompts, clinical reasoning scenarios, controlled failure, calibration, adaptive questioning, and analytics. Production readiness is high: all planned features shipped, automated tests are green, and deployments scripts + smoke tests are in place. No production incidents occurred.

## 2. Delivery Metrics

| Metric | Planned | Actual | Notes |
|--------|---------|--------|-------|
| Stories | 6 | 6 | 100% scope delivered |
| Story Points | ~78 | ~78 | Maintained estimate accuracy |
| Duration | 1 sprint (1 week) | 3 working days | Accelerated due to prior Epic foundations |
| Automated Tests | 65+ targeted tests | 65+ passing | API e2e (validation, analytics) + calibration unit tests |
| Smoke Coverage | N/A | 5 golden-path checks | New `npm run smoke` script wired |

---

## 3. What Went Well

- **Fast throughput** thanks to shared SSOT patterns for calibration/adaptive/IRT introduced earlier; minimized context switching.
- **Cross-service coordination** (Next.js + FastAPI) worked smoothly—Gemini/ChatMock error handling reused Epic 3 patterns.
- **Hardening tasks** (preflight, backup/verify) prevented last-minute drift and are now reusable for future epics.
- **Stakeholder alignment**: PM and DEV shared daily demos; stakeholders accepted all features without rework.

---

## 4. What Needs Improvement

- **Retro scheduling gap:** retrospective ran 3 days after completion; we need to trigger it immediately upon “Epic complete” status.
- **Telemetry readiness:** analytics dashboards exist but production monitoring alerts are still manual; need scripted checks post-launch.
- **Medium-priority review items** (docs/test improvements) surfaced late. We should timebox a “post-epic polish” window instead of ad‑hoc fixes.

## 5. Risks & Mitigations

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| Adaptive/IRT configs may drift without monitoring | Add automated preflight/smoke to CI & post-deploy checks (Action Item #1) |
| Peer benchmarking endpoints disabled by default—future collaborators may forget to enable | Document flag in deploy templates; add checklist reminder (Action Item #2) |
| Analytics dashboards rely on accurate calibration signals; no alerting if data stops flowing | Implement telemetry watch + Slack notify (Action Item #3) |

## 6. Action Items

| # | Action | Owner | Due | Status |
|---|--------|-------|-----|--------|
| 1 | Add nightly GitHub Action to run `npm run stage:smoke` & report failures | Kevy | 2025-10-24 | ☐ |
| 2 | Update deployment runbook template with `PEER_BENCHMARKING_ENABLED` guidance | Kevy | 2025-10-22 | ☐ |
| 3 | Add analytics heartbeat monitor (dashboard query + alert) | Amelia | 2025-10-31 | ☐ |
| 4 | Schedule 30‑min “post-epic polish” slot for medium-priority review fixes | Kevy | 2025-10-23 | ☐ |

---

## 7. Preparation for Epic 5 (Behavioral Learning Twin)

- Run **prep sprint (2 days)** to complete action items above and confirm telemetry before Epic 5 kickoff.
- Finalize Epic 5 story slate (already drafted) and ensure First Aid/knowledge graph dependencies are stable.
- Confirm ChatMock/Gemini quota for upcoming behavioral analytics workloads.

---

## 8. Key Lessons

1. **SSOT + preflight** significantly reduced regression risk; make them mandatory for future epics.  
2. **Golden-path smoke script** accelerated verification—extend it as new features land.  
3. **Retrospective trigger** should be part of “Epic Complete” Definition of Done to capture feedback immediately.

---

### Next Steps

1. Track action items in status file (owners + due dates).  
2. Execute prep sprint and monitor production telemetry during first week of Epic 4 usage.  
3. Kick off Epic 5 once action items 1–3 are complete.
