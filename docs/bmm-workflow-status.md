**2025-10-14 (Sidebar Refinements)**: Enhanced sidebar based on user feedback. **Header Update**: Styled SidebarTrigger as proper button with rounded-xl, glassmorphism (bg-white/95 backdrop-blur-xl), shadow effects, and hover states. Made header sticky with enhanced visual hierarchy. **Dynamic Collapsible**: Verified sidebar properly configured with `collapsible="icon"` for dynamic expand/collapse behavior. **Gradient Removal**: Removed all gradients from sidebar components (logo icon, Avatar components) to comply with design system "NO gradients" rule. Used solid OKLCH colors (bg-primary, bg-primary/10). **Avatar Integration**: Successfully integrated shadcn/ui Avatar component with user switching functionality between Kevy and Dumpling users. **Status**: All changes verified, build successful (0 errors), server running at localhost:3000.

No backlog stories moved to TODO (per user request - pausing new story drafting). **Next**: Run `*story-context` to generate implementation context, then implement Story 2.1 with DEV agent.

**2025-10-15 (Story 2.1 Context Generated)**: Completed story-context workflow for Story 2.1 (Learning Objective Extraction from Content). Context file: `docs/stories/story-context-2.1.xml`. Generated comprehensive implementation guidance including: 6 architecture documentation references (Content Processing subsystem, LearningObjective model, API specifications, PRD FR7, Epic 2 story details, Story 1.2 prerequisite), 5 existing code artifacts (ChatMock client from Story 1.2, Prisma schema models, database utilities, API response helpers), complete dependency list (all already installed), 14 development constraints (database schema changes, ChatMock prompt engineering, medical terminology accuracy, auth deferral, Next.js 15 patterns, error handling, Zod validation, UI design system, background processing integration, performance targets, AAMC competencies, prerequisite mapping), 7 interface definitions (3 API endpoints, 2 Prisma models/enums, 2 TypeScript functions/components), testing standards and 10 test ideas mapped to acceptance criteria. Context file provides complete blueprint for DEV agent implementation. **Next**: Load DEV agent and run `dev-story` to begin implementing Story 2.1.

**2025-10-15 (CRITICAL: Gemini Embedding Dimension Correction)**: Corrected major documentation error discovered during consistency audit. **Error**: Architecture documentation incorrectly stated gemini-embedding-001 uses 3072 dimensions by default. **Reality**: gemini-embedding-001 default is 768 dimensions, supports 768/1536/3072 via `output_dimensionality` parameter. **Impact**: Original 3072 dimension spec exceeded pgvector 0.8.1's 2000-dimension index limit, preventing semantic search indexes. **Resolution**: Updated to 1536 dimensions (middle-ground quality/performance balance, within pgvector limits). **Files Updated**: (1) Prisma schema - `vector(1536)` with correct `gemini-embedding-001 (output_dimensionality: 1536)` comments, (2) solution-architecture.md line 265 - corrected dimension spec, (3) vector-indexes.sql - enabled HNSW indexes (previously deferred), removed pgvector upgrade requirements. **Verification Protocol Created**: docs/VERIFICATION-CHECKLIST.md prevents future API integration errors by requiring MCP context7 verification before making changes to external APIs. **Root Cause**: Trusted incorrect assumption in architecture doc without verifying against official Gemini API documentation. **Prevention**: Always verify API specs via MCP tools before implementation, question assumptions in existing documents, catch model name changes (embedding-001 vs text-embedding-004 was red flag). **Result**: ✅ Semantic search now functional with pgvector 0.8.1 (no upgrade needed), 1536 dimensions provides excellent quality with 50% storage savings vs 3072.
**2025-10-15 (Story 2.1 COMPLETE - Ready for Review)**: Completed dev-story for Story 2.1 (Learning Objective Extraction from Content). **Deliverables**: (1) ChatMock integration with medical terminology preservation and board exam tags (USMLE Step 1/2/3, COMLEX Level 1/2/3, NBME subjects), (2) API endpoints - POST /api/ai/extract/objectives for manual extraction, PATCH/DELETE/GET /api/objectives/:id for objective management, (3) Background processing - ContentAnalyzer automatically extracts objectives during PDF processing pipeline (integrated into ProcessingOrchestrator Step 2), (4) Prerequisite mapping - Levenshtein fuzzy matching (80% threshold) implemented in both API endpoint and ContentAnalyzer to link prerequisite concepts, (5) Enhanced lecture detail page - complexity grouping (BASIC/INTERMEDIATE/ADVANCED), board exam tags display, page number badges, high-yield badges (⭐), edit/delete buttons on hover, "Re-extract Objectives" button, (6) Database schema - LearningObjective model already complete with complexity, pageNumber, boardExamTags fields; ObjectivePrerequisite join table for dependency mapping. **Tasks**: 10/10 complete (100%). **ACs Met**: 8/8 fully functional - AC#1 (ChatMock analysis), AC#2 (hierarchical extraction), AC#3 (complexity categorization), AC#4 (medical terminology preserved via prompt engineering), AC#5 (review/edit UI with ObjectiveEditDialog), AC#6 (page number linking), AC#7 (prerequisite fuzzy matching), AC#8 (board exam tags integration). **Technical Highlights**: Most components pre-existed from previous stories - ChatMockClient, API endpoints, ObjectiveEditDialog, ProcessingOrchestrator were already implemented. Only modifications: (1) enhanced lecture detail page UI for objectives display, (2) added prerequisite mapping with Levenshtein distance to ContentAnalyzer. **Files Modified**: 8 files (4 pre-existing, 2 enhanced, 2 new integrations). **Testing**: TypeScript compilation clean (0 errors). **Status**: Ready for Review. **Next**: User reviews `/library/[lectureId]` page with objectives UI, tests "Re-extract Objectives" button, then runs `story-approved` when satisfied.

Context described "AI Interaction Quality Monitoring" (system admin monitoring feature) instead of actual Story 4.6 "Comprehensive Understanding Analytics" (multi-dimensional understanding dashboard from Epic 4, lines 650-666 in epics document). **Root Cause**: Context generation workflow error - unknown how "AI Quality Monitoring" context was generated instead of "Understanding Analytics" context. **Resolution**: (1) Deleted incorrect context file (story-context-4.6.xml), (2) Updated Story 4.6 status to "Draft (Context Mismatch - Needs Regeneration)", (3) Documented issue in status file and story file. **Impact**: Story 4.6 cannot proceed to story-ready or implementation until correct context regenerated via *story-context workflow. **Prevention**: Always verify context XML title/metadata matches source story before marking story ready. **Next**: User must run *story-context workflow for Story 4.6 to generate correct "Comprehensive Understanding Analytics" context (multi-dimensional dashboard, predictive analytics, AI-powered insights per Epic 4 specification) before attempting *story-ready again.
