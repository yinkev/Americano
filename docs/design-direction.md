**Status:** Active

## Core Design Principles

### 1. Clarity & Focus with "Bento Box" Minimalism
Adopt a minimalist, flat "bento box" grid layout. Each module (e.g., "Today's Review," "Knowledge Graph," "Clinical Case") is a distinct, rounded-corner card. This reduces cognitive load (Cognitive Load Theory) and provides a clear visual hierarchy, allowing students to instantly know where to focus.

### 2. Soft, Purposeful Motion
Use `motion.dev` for subtle, physics-based animations that provide feedback without being distracting. For example, a gentle "wobble" on a completed task card or a fluid transition as a new learning path is recommended. This makes the interface feel alive and responsive, aligning with the "playful" aesthetic.

### 3. Functional Glassmorphism
Apply glassmorphism sparingly and with purpose. Use blurred, translucent surfaces for modal dialogs, sidebars, or focused "power-up" states. This creates a sense of depth and context, helping users maintain focus on the primary task while hinting at the content underneath, without overwhelming the design.

### 4. Intrinsic Gamification for Mastery
Design for intrinsic motivation. Instead of just points, focus on progress visualization through growing "brain maps" or unlocking new clinical case studies. Frame challenges as "intellectual sparring" against AI, tapping into the desire for competence and autonomy (Self-Determination Theory).

### 5. Adaptive & Personalized "Learning Companion"
The UI should feel like a personal tutor. The dashboard layout can adapt based on the Behavioral Learning Twin's analysis—surfacing flashcards for a visual learner or a challenging clinical text for a reading/writing learner. This hyper-personalization makes the student feel understood and supported.

### 6. Data Storytelling for Insight
Transform raw analytics into a compelling narrative. Instead of just charts, the dashboard should tell a story: "You've mastered 70% of Cardiology basics! Your speed on identifying arrhythmias has increased by 15%. Ready to tackle advanced ECGs?" This makes data actionable and emotionally resonant.

### 7. Psychology of Color & Calm
Utilize the OKLCH color system to create a soft, accessible, and calming palette. Use color to guide attention pre-attentively. For example, a single, vibrant accent color can highlight the most important action on the page (e.g., "Start Today's Session"), while the rest of the UI remains in soothing, analogous tones.

### 8. Ethical Engagement & Burnout Prevention
The UI should promote healthy learning habits. If the system detects signs of cognitive overload, the interface can proactively suggest a break with a playful animation or offer a 5-minute "low-stakes" review game. This positions Americano as a partner in well-being, not just a taskmaster.

### 9. Seamless Flow & "Cognitive Tunnels"
Create "cognitive tunnels" for complex tasks. When a student begins a clinical case, the UI should fade out distractions, using a subtle zoom or transition to focus entirely on the case. This minimizes context-switching and helps maintain deep focus, making learning more efficient.

### 10. Playful Discovery & "Serendipity Mode"
Incorporate elements of playful discovery. A "Surprise Me!" button could surface a random, interesting medical fact or a short, engaging case from a topic the student is strong in. This fosters curiosity and makes the learning process feel less like a chore and more like an exploration.
