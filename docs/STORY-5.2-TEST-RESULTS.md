## Prediction Model Testing (Task 13.3)

### Objective

### Test Method

**API Endpoint**: `POST /api/analytics/predictions/generate`

**Request Body**:
```json
{
  "userId": "<TEST_USER_ID>",
  "daysAhead": 7
}
```

### Expected Prediction Results

#### For Action Potential Objective

**Expected Probability**: 0.75-0.85 (HIGH)

**Calculation Logic** (Rule-Based Model):
1. Base probability: 0.3
2. **HIGH risk factors**:
   - `prerequisiteGapCount` > 0.5 → +0.35 (1.0 * 0.35)
   - `retentionScore` < 0.5 → +0.08 ((0.5 - 0.30) * 0.4)
   - `complexityMismatch` > 0.6 → +0.025 ((0.65 - 0.6) * 0.5)
   - `historicalStruggleScore` > 0.7 → +0.08 ((0.90 - 0.7) * 0.4)
3. **Total**: 0.3 + 0.35 + 0.08 + 0.025 + 0.08 = **0.835** ≈ **83%**

**Expected Confidence**: 0.75-0.85

**Confidence Calculation**:
- Data sufficiency: 13/15 = 0.87
- Historical data present: 1.0
- Prerequisite data present: 1.0
- Confidence = (0.87 * 0.6 + 1.0 * 0.2 + 1.0 * 0.2) = **0.82**

### Expected Reasoning

3. **retentionScore**: 0.08 contribution
   - "Low retention score (30%)"
4. **complexityMismatch**: 0.025 contribution
   - "Content complexity exceeds current ability level"
5. **reviewLapseRate**: 0.015 contribution
   - "High rate of review failures (70%)"

**Risk Factors**:
- "Missing 100% of prerequisites"
- "Low retention score (30%)"
- "Content complexity exceeds current ability level"
- "History of struggles in similar topics"
- "High rate of review failures (70%)"

      gte: subDays(new Date(), 7)
    }
  },
  include: {
    prediction: true
  }
});
```

**Retrain Model**:
```typescript
const trainingExamples = feedbackData.map(f => ({
  features: f.prediction.featureVector,
  label: f.actualStruggle ? 1 : 0
}));

const updatedModel = await strugglePredictionModel.updateModel(trainingExamples);
```

**Expected Output**:
