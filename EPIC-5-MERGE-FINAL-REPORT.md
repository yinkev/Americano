   ```

6. **Create Pull Request:**

## Risk Assessment

### Resolved Risks ✅
- ✅ Schema conflicts (systematically merged)
- ✅ Model naming conflicts (Epic 5 versions kept)
- ✅ Dependency conflicts (merged all packages)
- ✅ Data loss from Epic 3 (user decision: skip restoration)
- ✅ Epic 5 P0 work loss (all preserved)

### Remaining Risks ⚠️
- ⚠️ **Migration conflicts** - Need to test migration on clean DB
- ⚠️ **Test failures** - Some tests may fail due to Epic 4 integration (expected, not blockers)
- ⚠️ **Build issues** - TypeScript errors possible in files not yet reviewed

### Mitigation Plan
1. Run full test suite before pushing
2. Create staging environment for migration testing
3. Use feature flags for Epic 4 features if issues arise
4. Document rollback plan (git revert 057c2efe)
