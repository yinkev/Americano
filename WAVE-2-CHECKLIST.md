## 📊 Performance Targets

### Estimated Metrics
- [ ] **FCP (First Contentful Paint)**: <1s ⏳ *Needs Lighthouse test*
- [ ] **LCP (Largest Contentful Paint)**: <2s ⏳ *Needs Lighthouse test*
- [ ] **FID (First Input Delay)**: <100ms ⏳ *Needs user testing*
- [ ] **CLS (Cumulative Layout Shift)**: <0.1 ⏳ *Needs visual regression test*
- [ ] **Perceived Load Time**: <1s ⏳ *Needs user testing*

### Manual Testing Checklist
- [ ] Navigate to `/analytics/learning-patterns` - Skeleton shows <200ms
- [ ] Navigate to `/analytics/struggle-predictions` - Skeleton shows <200ms
- [ ] Navigate to `/analytics/cognitive-health` - Skeleton shows <200ms
- [ ] Navigate to `/analytics/behavioral-insights` - Skeleton shows <200ms
- [ ] Throttle network to "Slow 3G" - Skeletons still show instantly
- [ ] Verify no layout shift when content loads
- [ ] Test on mobile device (iPhone, Android)
- [ ] Test on tablet (iPad)
- [ ] Test in different browsers (Chrome, Safari, Firefox)

---

## 🚀 Deployment Readiness

### Pre-Deployment
- [x] All TypeScript errors resolved (except pre-existing)
- [x] No console errors
- [x] Proper error boundaries in place (via Suspense)
- [x] Loading states tested locally
- [x] Documentation complete

### Post-Deployment
- [ ] Monitor Web Vitals in production
- [ ] Collect user feedback on perceived performance
- [ ] Run Lighthouse audits
- [ ] Track Core Web Vitals (FCP, LCP, FID, CLS)
- [ ] Monitor error rates (Suspense boundaries)
