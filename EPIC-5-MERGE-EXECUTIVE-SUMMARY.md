# Epic 5 Merge to Main - Executive Summary

**Date:** 2025-10-21
**Analyst:** Claude Code Architecture Review
**Epic 5 Branch:** `feature/epic-5-behavioral-twin`
**Target Branch:** `main`

---

## Executive Overview

Epic 5 (Behavioral Twin Engine) is **25 commits behind main** and requires a complex three-way merge to reconcile changes from Epic 3 (Knowledge Graph), Epic 4 (Understanding Validation), and Epic 5's own substantial additions.

**Key Finding:** Epic 4 inadvertently **deleted all 21 models from Epic 3** when it merged to main, indicating parallel development without coordination. This creates a data loss risk that must be addressed during Epic 5's merge.

## Critical Metrics

| Metric | Value | Severity |
|--------|-------|----------|
| Commits Behind Main | 25 | Medium |
| Direct File Conflicts | 10 files | Low |
| Schema Conflicts | 1 file (schema.prisma) | **Critical** |
| Model Naming Conflicts | 2 models | High |
| Epic 3 Models Deleted | 21 models | **Critical** |
| Total Models to Reconcile | 48-55 models | High |
| Estimated Resolution Time | 6-8 hours | Medium |
| Data Loss Risk | Present | **High** |

- **Key Features:** Semantic search, FirstAid integration, conflict detection

### Epic 4: Understanding Validation Engine
- **Status:** Currently on main
- **Models Added:** 15 (Clinical scenarios, calibration, understanding prediction)
- **Dependencies Added:** d3, Playwright, json-schema-to-typescript
- **Scripts Added:** Type generation prebuild hook, calibration aggregation

---

## Epic 5 Additions (Not Yet Merged)

- **Key Features:**
  - Behavioral pattern tracking
  - Burnout prevention
  - Cognitive load monitoring
  - Personalization experiments
  - Struggle prediction & intervention
  - Session orchestration
- **Dependencies Added:** Redis (ioredis), animations (motion, canvas-confetti), MSW
- **Performance Optimizations:** Wave 1-4 completed, Redis caching implemented

---

## Conflict Breakdown

### 1. Schema Conflicts (CRITICAL)

**File:** `apps/web/prisma/schema.prisma`
**Conflict Type:** Three-way merge (Epic 3 removed, Epic 4 added, Epic 5 added)
**Lines Changed:** 2,642 lines of diff

**Model Naming Conflicts:**
- `BehavioralPattern` - Different implementations in Epic 4 vs Epic 5
- `BehavioralInsight` - Different implementations in Epic 4 vs Epic 5

**Recommended Resolution:**
- Rename Epic 4's `BehavioralPattern` → `UnderstandingPattern`
- Rename Epic 4's `BehavioralInsight` → `DailyUnderstandingInsight`
- Keep Epic 5's versions (more comprehensive)

### 2. Direct File Conflicts (10 files)

Most are straightforward - accept both changes and merge:
- `package.json` - Merge all dependencies
- `pnpm-lock.yaml` - Regenerate after merge
- `jest.setup.ts` - Add mocks from both epics
- Learning session API routes (3 files) - Merge functionality
- `missions/page.tsx` - UI updates from both sides
- `button.tsx` - Component enhancements
- `bmm-workflow-status.md` - Documentation updates

### 3. Epic 3 Model Restoration Decision (CRITICAL)

**Question:** Should we restore Epic 3's 21 deleted models?

**Investigation Required:**
1. Check production database for Epic 3 table data
2. Verify if FirstAid/semantic search features are active
3. Determine if Epic 3 API routes are still in use

**Recommendations:**
- **IF production has Epic 3 data** → MUST restore all 21 models (prevent data loss)
- **IF Epic 3 never deployed** → Skip restoration (cleaner schema)
- **Hybrid approach** → Restore only FirstAid models (7), skip search (14)

---

## Merge Strategy

### Recommended: Three-Way Manual Merge

**Rationale:**
- Preserves all three epics' functionality
- Prevents data loss from Epic 3
- Allows deliberate conflict resolution
- Generates clean migration history

**Steps:**
1. Create reconciliation branch: `git checkout -b epic-5-main-reconciliation`
2. Backup Epic 5 schema: `cp apps/web/prisma/schema.prisma /tmp/epic5-backup`
3. Merge main: `git merge origin/main` (expect conflicts)
4. Manually reconcile schema.prisma:
   - Decide on Epic 3 model restoration
   - Add Epic 4's 15 models with renamed conflicts
   - Keep Epic 5's 33 models
   - Total: 48-55 models depending on Epic 3 decision
5. Resolve other file conflicts (straightforward)
6. Merge package.json dependencies
7. Generate migration: `npx prisma migrate dev --name epic_3_4_5_reconciliation`
8. Test thoroughly: `npm run test:integration`
9. Commit and push for review

**Estimated Time:** 6-8 hours
**Risk Level:** Medium (complex but methodical)

## Risk Assessment

### High Risks
- **Data Loss from Epic 3 Removal** - If production has Epic 3 data and we don't restore models
- **Model Name Conflicts** - If BehavioralPattern/Insight not renamed properly
- **Migration Failure** - If 3-way schema merge creates invalid SQL

### Medium Risks
- **Dependency Conflicts** - Multiple epics added/removed packages
- **Test Failures** - Integration between three epic features untested together
- **Performance Regression** - Combined schema size impact on query performance

### Mitigations
- Comprehensive testing on staging environment before production
- Database backup before migration
- Feature flags for Epic 3/4 features if issues arise
- Rollback plan documented

---

## Success Criteria

### Merge Completion
- [ ] All schema conflicts resolved with no duplicate model names
- [ ] Migration runs successfully on clean database
- [ ] All dependencies from Epic 4 and Epic 5 present
- [ ] TypeScript compilation succeeds with no errors
- [ ] All test suites pass (Epic 4 + Epic 5)

### Functional Validation
- [ ] Epic 4 calibration features work
- [ ] Epic 5 behavioral analytics features work
- [ ] Epic 3 features work (if restored)
- [ ] Redis connection established (Epic 5)
- [ ] Type generation script executes (Epic 4)

### Performance Validation
- [ ] No regression in API response times
- [ ] Database query performance acceptable
- [ ] Redis caching operational (Epic 5 Wave 2)

## Immediate Next Steps

### Priority 1: Epic 3 Status Investigation (1 hour)
```bash
# Connect to production DB and check for Epic 3 data
# Query tables: FirstAidSection, SearchQuery, etc.
# Document findings
```

**Decision Point:** Restore Epic 3 models or skip?

### Priority 2: Create Reconciliation Branch (15 min)
```bash
git checkout -b epic-5-main-reconciliation
git fetch origin main
cp apps/web/prisma/schema.prisma /tmp/epic5-schema.backup
```

### Priority 3: Begin Merge (4-6 hours)
Follow detailed steps in `MERGE-QUICK-REFERENCE.md`

### Priority 4: Testing & Validation (2 hours)
Comprehensive test suite execution

## Questions for Stakeholders

### Product Team
1. Are Epic 3 FirstAid/semantic search features active in production?
2. What's the priority order: Epic 3 vs Epic 4 vs Epic 5 features?
3. What's the deadline for Epic 5 merge to main?

### Engineering Team
4. Why did Epic 4 remove Epic 3 models? Was this known/intentional?
5. Do we have production database backups we can query for Epic 3 data?
6. Should we create an Architecture Decision Record (ADR) for the 3-way merge?

### DevOps Team
7. Can we get a production database snapshot for analysis?
8. What's the rollback process if merge causes production issues?
9. Should we schedule a maintenance window for this merge?

## Conclusion

The Epic 5 merge requires careful three-way reconciliation of schema changes from three parallel epic developments. The critical decision point is whether to restore Epic 3's 21 deleted models.

**Recommended Path Forward:**
1. Investigate Epic 3 production status (1 hour)
2. Make Epic 3 restoration decision (stakeholder input)
3. Execute three-way manual merge (6-8 hours)
4. Comprehensive testing before production deployment

**Confidence Level:** High - Process is complex but well-documented and methodical.

**Blocker Risk:** Medium - Dependent on Epic 3 investigation results and stakeholder decisions.
